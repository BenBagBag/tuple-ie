<p>Cyanobacteria are the only bacteria that contain chlorophyll A, a chemical required for oxygenic photosynthesis (the same process used by plants and algae) 1,14. This process uses carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce oxygen and glucose (sugars) for energy. Chlorophyll A is used to capture the energy from sunlight to help this process. Other bacteria can be considered photosynthesizing organisms, but they follow a different process known as bacterial photosynthesis, or anoxygenic photosynthesis 14. This process uses bacteriochlorophyll instead of chlorophyll A 19. These bacteria cells use carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide (instead of water) to manufacture sugars. Bacteria cannot use oxygen in photosynthesis, and therefore produce energy anaerobically (without oxygen) 18. Cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton photosynthesize as plants do, and produce the same sugar and oxygen for use in cellular respiration.</p>

between two cells F plasmid mobilized for transfer Binds to site just beneath pilus Rolling-circle replication: DNA replication occurs at binding point Replicated DNA sent to connected cell fig 18.23 Process called conjugation Transfer of integrated F plasmid Similar process where entire genome copied and transferred Process used to locate gene positions on chromosome fig 18.24 Transposition Transposons randomly move about chromosomes fig 18.25 Transposons encode transposase enzyme Selects random site and inserts transposon fig 18.26 Destination random since enzyme doesn't recognize any particular sequence Transposition relatively rare, has enormous evolutionary impact Causes mutation Insertion of mobile element destroys gene's function Called insertional inactivation May be the cause of spontaneous mutations Facilitates gene mobilization Genes located elsewhere brought to one location Generates composite plasmid with similar genes Example: resistance transfer factors Patients treated with many antibiotics at once Bacteria contain antibiotic resistance genes Surviving bacteria have many genes on one plasmid Plasmid readily passed to other bacteria Antibiotics no longer effective RECIPROCAL RECOMBINATION Chromosomes Trade Sections Important in eukaryotes Example: meiotic crossing-over Crossing Over Occurs during Prophase I of meiosis Homologous chromosomes pair side-by-side Exchange of strands at one or more locations fig 12.6 May result in physical exchange of chromosome arms Produce chromosomes differing in mutation combination Form gametes with new combination of alleles Example: giraffe Neck length gene and leg length gene on same chromosome Mutations to form long-neck allele and long-leg allele Unlikely event to get both alleles in same individual Recombination could readily cause cross-over of alleles Gene Conversion Homologues not identical thus nucleotides not complementary Called mismatch pairs Error corrected by proofreading enzymes Excise strand, fill gap complementary to other strand Produces two chromosomes with same sequence One mismatch pair lost, called gene conversion fig 18.27 Unequal Crossing Over Pairing mistake due to same sequences at many locations Homologues line up, sequence matches with a duplicate Results in unequal crossing over fig 18.28 Exchange segments of unequal length One chromosome gains copies

<p>exposed in the DOM. And third, notice that the text is treated as a node in the DOM and is accessible through the childNodes collection. An important distinction about a TextNode is that it cannot contain any child nodes. Creating Nodes Nodes are created using the createElement and createTextNode methods. Both methods are exposed only to the document object, and can be used in HTML documents, DHTML Behaviors , and HTML Applications . In the DHTML Object Model, elements are added to the document hierarchy by modifying the innerHTML and outerHTML property values, or by using methods explicit to particular elements, such as the insertRow and insertCell methods for the table element. With the createElement method, only the name of the element is needed. Use the following syntax to create a new element. // Create an element var oElement = document.createElement(sElementName); The createElement method is available in Internet Explorer 4.0, but only the area , img , and option elements can be created. As of Internet Explorer 5, all elements can be created stand-alone. In addition, read-only properties, such as id , are read-write for stand-alone elements before they are inserted into the document hierarchy. Some elements might require additional steps or rely on the existence of other elements. For example, the TYPE attribute of the input element defaults to text . So, to create a button control, the type property needs to be set to button , and the value property should be set to provide a label. The following sample code highlights how a fieldSet , legend , and button control are created in script to build a short form. Notice that one function is designed to create and append the elements, and a reference to the new element is returned so additional elements can be appended as children. function fnCreate(sElement,sData,sType,oNode){ var oNewElement=document.createElement(sElement); if(sType){ oNewElement.type=sType; oNewElement.value=sData; } if(sData){ if(sElement.toLowerCase()!="input"){ var oNewText=document.createTextNode(sData); oNewElement.appendChild(oNewText); } } if(oNode){ oNode.appendChild(oNewElement); } else{ oNewForm.appendChild(oNewElement); } return oNewElement; } var oNode=fnCreate("FIELDSET"); fnCreate("LEGEND","My Form","",oNode); fnCreate("INPUT","Some Text","text",oNode); fnCreate("INPUT","A button","button",oNode); This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. When creating and threading together nodes, it is important to use well-formed HTML to avoid creating an invalid tree. By creating and adding an invalid tree into the document hierarchy, unpredictable behavior can ensue. For the most part, Web authors need not be concerned. However, there are some elements, such as table , that warrant special discussion. A well-formed HTML table consists of at least two nodes: table and tBody . In the DHTML Object Model, a table , with accompanying rows and cells, can be created using the innerHTML property, the insertRow and insertCell methods, and the rows and cells collections. While the tBody element is not explicitly added, it is created as a part of the table object model. For example, the following code generates a two-cell table using the DHTML Object Model. var sTable="&lt;TABLE ID='oTable1'&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;" document.body.innerHTML+=sTable; oTable1.insertRow(oTable1.rows.length); oTable1.insertRow(oTable1.rows.length); oTable1.rows(0).insertCell(oTable1.rows(0).cells.length); oTable1.rows(0).insertCell(oTable1.rows(0).cells.length); oTable1.rows(0).cells(0).innerHTML="Cell 1"; oTable1.rows(0).cells(1).innerHTML="Cell 2"; The following HTML is the result of the previous code. Notice that the tBody element exists even though it was not added in script. &lt;TABLE ID="oTable"&gt; &lt;TBODY&gt; &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Cell 1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Cell 2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt; &lt;/TBODY&gt; &lt;/TABLE&gt; To create a well-formed table in the DOM, the tBody element must be explicitly created and added to the tree. By not including the tBody element, the nodes comprising the entire table form an invalid tree and result in unpredictable behavior. The following script outlines the creation of a table using the DOM, including the tBody element. var oTable=document.createElement("TABLE"); var oTBody=document.createElement("TBODY"); var oRow=document.createElement("TR"); var oCell=document.createElement("TD"); var oCell2=oCell.cloneNode(); oRow.appendChild(oCell); oRow.appendChild(oCell2); oTable.appendChild(oTBody); oTBody.appendChild(oRow); document.body.appendChild(oTable); oCell.innerHTML="Cell 1"; oCell2.innerHTML="Cell 2"; Manipulating Nodes Once a node is created, and its relationship with other nodes is identified, it can be manipulated. A node can be updated without any knowledge of what nodes are adjacent to it, but it is a good idea to know what could be affected if a node is altered. For example, if a Web author wants to remove portions of a list, removing the topmost node and all its children might delete information that should have been preserved. In addition, removing only the topmost node of a list might cause additional problems later because the existing list items would still exist, without the ol or ul parent. Some of the DOM methods that allow authors to easily manipulate nodes are the cloneNode , removeNode , replaceNode , and swapNode methods. These methods provide copy, move, and delete functionality to the entire document tree. Understanding how a node interacts with other nodes helps keep a document clean and the client-side script stable. For example, consider the following list code. &lt;UL ID=oParent&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Item 1 &lt;LI ID=oNode2&gt;Item 2 &lt;OL ID=oSubList&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Sub Item 1 &lt;LI&gt;Sub Item 2 &lt;LI&gt;Sub Item 3 &lt;/OL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Item 3 &lt;/UL&gt; Manipulating nodes can be tricky because it is very easy to build invalid tree structures. For example, to copy one of the list items represented in the previous HTML and paste it</p>

The following script outlines the creation of a table using the DOM, including the tBody element. var oTable=document.createElement("TABLE"); var oTBody=document.createElement("TBODY"); var oRow=document.createElement("TR"); var oCell=document.createElement("TD"); var oCell2=oCell.cloneNode(); oRow.appendChild(oCell); oRow.appendChild(oCell2); oTable.appendChild(oTBody); oTBody.appendChild(oRow); document.body.appendChild(oTable); oCell.innerHTML="Cell 1"; oCell2.innerHTML="Cell 2"; Manipulating Nodes Once a node is created, and its relationship with other nodes is identified, it can be manipulated. A node can be updated without any knowledge of what nodes are adjacent to it, but it is a good idea to know what could be affected if a node is altered. For example, if a Web author wants to remove portions of a list, removing the topmost node and all its children might delete information that should have been preserved. In addition, removing only the topmost node of a list might cause additional problems later because the existing list items would still exist, without the ol or ul parent. Some of the DOM methods that allow authors to easily manipulate nodes are the cloneNode , removeNode , replaceNode , and swapNode methods. These methods provide copy, move, and delete functionality to the entire document tree. Understanding how a node interacts with other nodes helps keep a document clean and the client-side script stable. For example, consider the following list code. &lt;UL ID=oParent&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Item 1 &lt;LI ID=oNode2&gt;Item 2 &lt;OL ID=oSubList&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Sub Item 1 &lt;LI&gt;Sub Item 2 &lt;LI&gt;Sub Item 3 &lt;/OL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Item 3 &lt;/UL&gt; Manipulating nodes can be tricky because it is very easy to build invalid tree structures)</td>

<p>fatty acid chains in a phospholipid molecule Phosphate group attaches a polar organic alcohol to the third carbon One end of the molecule is strongly nonpolar and water insoluble The other end is strongly polar and water soluble Phospholipids are diagrammed as a polar head with two nonpolar tails Phospholipids Form Bilayer Sheets Interactions between phospholipids and water Nonpolar tails are pushed away from water molecules Nonpolar tails cannot form hydrogen bonds with water Water molecules form bonds with each other excluding nonpolar tails Spontaneously form a lipid bilayer fig 6.3 Polar heads face water on either side Nonpolar tails face inward toward each other Lipid bilayer sheets are the foundation of biological membranes Nonpolar interior repels water-soluble molecules Proteins in the lipid bilayer allow passage of polar molecules The Lipid Bilayer Is Fluid Lipid molecules move within the stable bilayer Closely aligned tails create less fluid membranes Less closely aligned tails create more fluid membranes Associated with double-bonded carbons in the tail chain May contain short lipids that prevent contact between tails fig 6.4 ARCHITECTURE OF THE PLASMA MEMBRANE Cell Membranes Are Assembled From Four Components tbl 6.1 Lipid bilayer foundation fig 6.5 Other components distributed within foundation Provides a flexible matrix which is a barrier to permeability Transmembrane proteins fig 6.6 Move within the lipid bilayer, not located in fixed positions Provide channels through which molecules and information pass Network of supporting fibers fig 6.7 Structurally supported by proteins like spectrin Connects membrane proteins to cell's actin filament cytoskeleton Control lateral motion of key membrane proteins fig 6.8 Exterior proteins and glycolipids Membranes assembled in the ER, transferred to the Golgi Golgi adds glycocalyx, chains of sugars, to membrane proteins and lipids fig 6.9 Sugar molecules function as cell identity markers Some Proteins Traverse the Lipid Bilayer Via single spiral helix of nonpolar amino acids fig 6.10 Include receptor proteins Portion of receptor that sticks outward binds with molecules Binding induces changes in part of protein on the inside Channel proteins wind back and forth through the membrane Create a hole in the membrane like that in a donut Locked into shape by several nonpolar helical segments Water-soluble molecules pass through these channels Example: photosynthetic transmembrane protein Non-polar beta-pleated sheet transmembrane proteins Characteristic motif where sheets fold back over themselves Form a pore called a beta-barrel Examples include porins of bacterial outer membranes fig 6.11 HOW A CELL'S PLASMA MEMBRANE REGULATES INTERACTIONS WITH ITS ENVIRONMENT Structure of the Membrane Enables a Broad Range of Interactions fig 6.12 Interactions With the Environment Include Passage of water Passage of bulk material Selective transport of molecules Reception of information Expression of cell identity Physical connection with other cells THE PASSAGE OF WATER INTO AND OUT OF CELLS Molecules Dissolved in Water Are in Constant Random Motion Diffusion fig 6.13 Causes net movement from higher to lower concentration Equilibrium when there is uniform concentration Aqueous solution: a mixture of water and molecules Solvent: water, most common molecules in the solution Solute: other molecules dissolved in the water Both water and molecules diffuse down their concentration gradient Osmosis Membrane prevents equal motion of solvent and solute Many solutes cannot pass through biological membranes Water can freely pass through membrane Osmosis: diffusion with net movement of water across a membrane fig 6.14 Concentration of all solutes establishes osmotic concentration Solution with higher concentration is hyperosmotic Solution with lower concentration is hypoosmotic Solutions with equal concentrations are isosmotic Cellular changes fig 6.15 Shrinks (looses water) when hypoosmotic to environment Swells (gains water) when hyperosmotic to environment Hydrostatic pressure of cytoplasm pushes against cell membrane Osmotic pressure: force required to stop osmosis across membrane fig 6.16 Equilibrium between osmotic concentration difference and pressure When pressure is too high most unsupported cells burst Cells with cell walls can withstand pressure and will not burst fig 6.17 Maintaining Osmotic Balance Many cells adjust internal solute concentration to match environment Cells are isosmotic with environment Cell is in osmotic balance with environment Multicellular organisms similarly regulate composition of body fluids Water removal Gaining water is a dilemma of eukaryotes in fresh water Hyperosmotic with respect to environment Water removal, extrusion, requires expenditure of energy Example: contractile vacuole of Paramecium Plant cell walls Plant cells do not circulate in isosmotic solution Cells are hyperosmotic with respect to their immediate environment Possess a high solute concentration within the central vacuole Osmotic pressure pushes cytoplasm against cell wall, causes rigidity Turgor pressure: internal pressure of plant cells BULK PASSAGE INTO AND OUT OF THE CELL Phagocytosis and Pinocytosis Mechanism to get large polar molecules through cell membrane Called endocytosis fig 6.18 Membrane encircles and engulfs food particle Part of exterior medium captured within a vesicle Phagocytosis: material brought in is particulate Pinocytosis: material is liquid, contains dissolved molecules Receptor-mediated endocytosis Associated with transport of specific macromolecules Cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane is covered with clathrin Indentations in plasma membrane called clathrin-coated pits fig 6.19 Pit closes over when proper molecule enters Process is highly specific, very fast but transient Fluid-phase endocytosis is same process with fluids Exocytosis: Reverse of Endocytosis Materials extruded from cell by discharge from surface vesicles fig 6.20 Utilized by plants to construct cell wall Includes protist contractile vacuole discharge Used by animal cells to secrete chemical materials SELECTIVE TRANSPORT OF SUBSTANCES ACROSS MEMBRANES Disadvantages of Endocytosis and Exocytosis Requires expenditure of large amounts of energy Not usually selective to materials brought inward Selective permeability gained through use of channels or carriers Diffusion of Ions Through Channels Review definitions of ion, cation and anion Due to charge, ions are repelled by non-polar lipid bilayer interior Movement of ions requires membrane transport proteins Water-filled pore spans membrane No interaction between channel and ion Net movement dependent on
