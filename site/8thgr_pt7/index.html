<p>or script that takes the information submitted in a form and processes it. Because of the need for specialized scripts to handle the incoming form information, fill-out forms are not discussed in this primer. Check the Additional Online Reference section for more information. Troubleshooting Avoid Overlapping Tags Consider this example of HTML: &lt;B&gt;This is an example of &lt;I&gt;overlapping&lt;/B&gt; HTML tags.&lt;/I&gt; The word overlapping is contained within both the &lt;B&gt; and &lt;I&gt; tags. A browser might be confused by this coding and might not display it the way you intend. The only way to know is to check each popular browser (which is time-consuming and impractical). In general, avoid overlapping tags. Look at your tags and try pairing them up. Tags (with the obvious exceptions of elements whose end tags may be omitted, such as paragraphs) should be paired without an intervening tag in between. Look again at the example above. You cannot pair the bold tags without another tag in the middle (the first definition tag). Try matching your coding up like this to see if you have any problem areas that should be fixed before you release your files to a server. Embed Only Anchors and Character Tags HTML protocol allows you to embed links within other HTML tags: &lt;H1&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt;My heading&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; Do not embed HTML tags within an anchor: &lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt; &lt;H1&gt;My heading&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;/A&gt; Although most browsers currently handle this second example, the official HTML specifications do not support this construct and your file will probably not work with future browsers. Remember that browsers can be forgiving when displaying improperly coded files. But that forgiveness may not last to the next version of the software! When in doubt, code your files according to the HTML specifications (see For More Information below). Character tags modify the appearance of the text within other elements: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;A bold list item&lt;/B&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;I&gt;An italic list item&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/UL&gt; Avoid embedding other types of HTML element tags. For example, you might be tempted to embed a heading within a list in order to make the font size larger: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H1&gt;A large heading&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H2&gt;Something slightly smaller&lt;/H2&gt; &lt;/UL&gt; Although some browsers handle this quite nicely, formatting of such coding is unpredictable (because it is undefined). For compatibility with all browsers, avoid these kinds of constructs. (The Netscape &lt;FONT&gt; tag, which lets you specify how large individual characters will be displayed in your window, is not currently part of the official HTML specifications.) What's the difference between embedding a &lt;B&gt; within a &lt;LI&gt; tag as opposed to embedding a &lt;H1&gt; within a &lt;LI&gt; ? Within HTML the semantic meaning of &lt;H1&gt; is that it's the main heading of a document and that it should be followed by the content of the document. Therefore it doesn't make sense to find a &lt;H1&gt; within a list. Character formatting tags also are generally not additive. For example, you might expect that: &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;some text&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; would produce bold-italic text. On some browsers it does; other browsers interpret only the innermost tag. Do the Final Steps Validate Your Code When you put a document on a Web server, be sure to check the formatting and each link (including named anchors). Ideally you will have someone else read through and comment on your file(s) before you consider a document finished. You can run your coded files through one of several on-line HTML validation services that will tell you if your code conforms to accepted HTML. If you are not sure your coding conforms to HTML specifications, this can be a useful teaching tool. Fortunately the service lets you select the level of conformance you want for your files (i.e., strict, level 2, level 3). If you want to use some codes that are not officially part of the HTML specifications, this latitude is helpful. Dummy Images When an &lt;IMG SRC&gt; tag points to an image that does not exist, a dummy image is substituted by your browser software. When this happens during your final review of your files, make sure that the referenced image does in fact exist, that the hyperlink has the correct information in the URL, and that the file permission is set appropriately (world-readable). Then check online again! Update Your Files If the contents of a file are static (such as a biography of George Washington), no updating is probably needed. But for documents that are time sensitive or covering a field that changes frequently, remember to update your documents! Updating is particularly important when the file contains information such as a weekly schedule or a deadline for a program funding announcement. Remove out-of-date files or note why something that appears dated is still on a server (e.g., the program requirements will remain the same for the next cycle so the file is still available as an interim reference). Browsers Differ Web browsers display HTML elements differently. Remember that not all codes used in HTML files are interpreted by all browsers. Any code a browser does not understand is usually ignored though. You could spend a lot of time making your file &quot;look perfect&quot; using your current browser. If you check that file using another browser, it will likely display (a little or a lot) differently. Hence these words of</p>

<p>Paleontology II LAYERS AND LAYERS since the late 18th century the evolution of the earth has been interpreted through investigation of the evolution of life-WILLIAM SMITH (1769-1839), in the course of working on canal excavations all over England, noticed that the same series of fossil assemblages could be found again and again-he was eventually able to predict both the order of fossil assemblages and the thickness of a given stratum at any locality before a hole was even dug-he could do this because he realized that the slabs of sedimentary rock were draped over he each other like a stack of really thick blankets on a badly made bed-each layer had a characteristic group of fossils in it that were found where ever that layer of rock was found-Smith had been in charge of digging a lot of holes and had traced each stratum laterally over great distances Smith, like most engineers, was not a philosopher and drew no grand conclusions from his work-it was simply a practical tool to use in canal and mine construction-he didn't care whether the fossils represented organic remains or were simply "sports of nature"-he had no interest in whether or not he was documenting the evolution of the earth, but other people looked at his work and realized that he was Smith invented STRATIGRAPHY without realizing its implications-we will get to this topic later in the semester-for now it is important to realized that Smith used FOSSILS to create an ORDINAL SYSTEM for organizing rocks-an ordinal system is one that imposes order by describing a unique series of events-anywhere you find any part of that unique series of events, you have found a part of that system-in this case the system was describing the series of events that is the history of the earth-the events are recognized by the groups of fossils that define them on a much shorter timescale think of the artifacts that characterize the post-war decades in US history-if you see black&amp;white TVs, cars with big tail fins, women wearing bobby sox and men wearing pompadours, you know you are within about 5 years of 1957-if you see lava lamps, leather jackets with long fringes, and eight track tapes, you know you are within 5 year of 1967-and so on-paleontologists do the same thing with fossils, except they have look at rocks and sediments instead of archive footage in libraries and boxes in attics this means that to understand the evolution of the earth, it would help if you could recognize some fossils-in order to keep all the fossils straight, it will help if you know how biota are classified EARLIEST FOSSIL EVIDENCE it is possible, in theory, that whole other kingdoms of biota existed, but we have found no fossil evidence as yet earliest fossils are of prokaryotic organisms in rocks ~3.5 billion years old-this is approximately a billion years after the earth</p>

<p>Pearcy believes that the migration of predatory fishes such as mackerel and Pacific hake into the ocean off the Pacific Northwest during warm water conditions is the &quot;most likely cause&quot; of salmon depletion.27 Dr. Steven Hare of the Pacific Halibut Commission and Drs. Nathan Mantua and Robert Francis of the University of Washington conclude that the variability in ocean conditions is pivotal to salmon abundance and agree that salmon management programs on freshwater streams cannot compensate for the negative influences of the ocean.28 While citing the need for continued improvements in freshwater management programs, these scientists believe that the only way West Coast salmon will rebound is when the PDO reverses itself and the ocean once again cools.</p>

<p>Physical weathering the disintegration of rock by mechanical forces concentrated along rock fractures the separation of rock into concentric layers is called exfoliation in rock masses and spheriodal or onion skin weathering in boulders: frost shattering the force of water in rock fractures as it freezes and expands, or is forced into the rock by the pressure of freezing water the most common physical weathering process, given the widespread distribution of frost (even in the tropic at high elevations) most effective in coastal arctic and alpine environments where there are hundreds of frost cycles per year the specific volume (vol./unit mass) of water increases by 9% upon freezing producing stress that is greater than the strength of all common rocks pressure (stress) release exfoliation of a rock mass as it expands in response to the removal of adjacent rock the most common mechanism of stress release is the erosion of overlying rock by erosion the rock disintegrates along dilation (expansion) fractures that conform to the surface topography and increase in spacing with depth salt weathering growth of salt crystals in rock fractures with the evaporation of saline groundwater causes mostly granular disintegration the salt is in solution and precipitate as soil water and groundwater evaporate it is most effective in dry landscapes where water tables are near the surface ( e.g. , saline seeps) the salt is derived from sea water, the chemical weathering of marine or evaporite sediments, snow and rain hydration wetting, swelling and disintegration of soil aggregates and fine grained rocks caused by the expansion and contraction with wetting and drying also the pressure of air drawn into pores under dry conditions and then trapped as water advances into soil and rock e.g ., biotite expands 40% by volume contributing to the weathering of granite insolation (thermal) weathering expansion and contraction with wetting and drying the surface temperature of dark colored rock can vary from 0-50 o C between day and night, since rock (especially jointed rock) has low thermal conductivity the differential stresses of expansion and contraction of the outer 1-5 cm of rock causes separation of concentric shallow layers called spalling or spheroidal weathering in boulders Chemical weathering the decomposition of rock by chemical reactions occurs in water, especially soil water and groundwater are rich in dissolved carbon dioxide produced during the decomposition of plants carbonation dissolving of calcium carbonate (limestone) in acidic groundwater similar to hydroloysis but the all the products are ionic, there is no residue bicarbonate (HCO 3 - ) is a product of carbonation and a major part of the dissolved load of most rivers the carbonation of limestone results in karst topography: caves, sinkholes, etc. chelation bonding of mineral cations and organic molecules produced by plants these chelates are stable at a pH at which the cation would normally precipitate and thus they are leached in seeping soil water H + released during chelation from organic molecules is available for hydrolysis thus plants, such as the lichens on bare rocks, contribute to the decomposition of soil and rock hydrolysis mineral cations ( e.g. , Ca + , Fe + , Na + , K + , Al + ) are replaced by hydrogen ions (H + ) from acidic water the most common weathering process pure water is a poor H+ donor, however biogenic CO 2 dissolves in water to produce carbonic acid: the weathering products are in solution or a residue is clay, that is, the first stage of soil development the soil water solution becomes more basic as H+ is consumed oxidation loss of an electron to dissolved oxygen iron is the most commonly oxidized mineral element Fe +2 (ferrous iron)</p>

<p>Re-Phyto-Lize Marine Phytoplankton is carefully cultivated in a strictly controlled photo-bioreactor environment, to ensure the cleanest most nutritious product free of common contaminants such as heavy metals and PCB's. The process involves periodic renewing of the strains and micro-algae cultures to maintain maximum quality. There is a continuous monitoring process, to assess parameters such as pH, cell density, CO2 levels, and nitrate levels. These quality checks are critical for an optimal product. The harvested phytoplankton is ultimately freeze-dried to a single cell powder. The powders are then carefully tested to ensure the highest quality, safest product available. These quality tests are done on each batch and include safety assessment parameters to ensure that the product is free of pathogenic bacteria, heavy metals, and molds. It is  very potent, there are no fillers or stretching compounds in our phytoplankton. It is available in capsules for those who prefer not to taste it, or powder form for the best price per gram.</p>

Surface streams and groundwater these are 2 very important sources of municipal water there are pollution problems associated with these which we will consider later in the semester---pollution sources as landfills, factories, septic tanks, etc. also important erosional and depositional features associated with these will be treated in detail such as caves and stalactites click here to see page 266(286) and cave deposits important features as sinkholes formed from the action of groundwater can cause structural failure of buildings and considerable surface collapse click here to see a large sinkhole J. Glaciers some depositional features caused by glaciers are important in the cement and concrete industries during the "Great Ice Age" of North America glaciers cut the basin of the Great Lakes and was the source of much of the lake water click here to see page 297(318) and the extent of global ice cover during "Great Ice Age" the glacial ice of Greenland and Antarctica comprises about 96% of all global ice and if all of the ice melted sea level would rise about 215 feet which means any coastal land presently below 215 feet elevation would be submerged K.

<p>server for some action. For example, suppose you collect names and email addresses so you can email some information to people who request it. For each person who enters his or her name and address, you need some information to be sent and the respondent's particulars added to a data base. This processing of incoming data is usually handled by a script or program written in Perl or another language that manipulates text, files, and information. If you cannot write a program or script for your incoming information, you need to find someone who can do this for you. The forms themselves are not hard to code. They follow the same constructs as other HTML tags. What could be difficult is the program or script that takes the information submitted in a form and processes it. Because of the need for specialized scripts to handle the incoming form information, fill-out forms are not discussed in this primer. Check the Additional Online Reference section for more information. Troubleshooting Avoid Overlapping Tags Consider this example of HTML: &lt;B&gt;This is an example of &lt;I&gt;overlapping&lt;/B&gt; HTML tags.&lt;/I&gt; The word overlapping is contained within both the &lt;B&gt; and &lt;I&gt; tags. A browser might be confused by this coding and might not display it the way you intend. The only way to know is to check each popular browser (which is time-consuming and impractical). In general, avoid overlapping tags. Look at your tags and try pairing them up. Tags (with the obvious exceptions of elements whose end tags may be omitted, such as paragraphs) should be paired without an intervening tag in between. Look again at the example above. You cannot pair the bold tags without another tag in the middle (the first definition tag). Try matching your coding up like this to see if you have any problem areas that should be fixed before you release your files to a server. Embed Only Anchors and Character Tags HTML protocol allows you to embed links within other HTML tags: &lt;H1&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt;My heading&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; Do not embed HTML tags within an anchor: &lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt; &lt;H1&gt;My heading&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;/A&gt; Although most browsers currently handle this second example, the official HTML specifications do not support this construct and your file will probably not work with future browsers. Remember that browsers can be forgiving when displaying improperly coded files. But that forgiveness may not last to the next version of the software! When in doubt, code your files according to the HTML specifications (see For More Information below). Character tags modify the appearance of the text within other elements: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;A bold list item&lt;/B&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;I&gt;An italic list item&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/UL&gt; Avoid embedding other types of HTML element tags. For example, you might be tempted to embed a heading within a list in order to make the font size larger: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H1&gt;A large heading&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H2&gt;Something slightly smaller&lt;/H2&gt; &lt;/UL&gt; Although some browsers handle this quite nicely, formatting of such coding is unpredictable (because it is undefined). For compatibility with all browsers, avoid these kinds of constructs. (The Netscape &lt;FONT&gt; tag, which lets you specify how large individual characters will be displayed in your window, is not currently part of the official HTML specifications.) What's the difference between embedding a &lt;B&gt; within a &lt;LI&gt; tag as opposed to embedding a &lt;H1&gt; within a &lt;LI&gt; ? Within HTML the semantic meaning of &lt;H1&gt; is that it's the main heading of a document and that it should be followed by the content of the document. Therefore it doesn't make sense to find a &lt;H1&gt; within a list. Character formatting tags also are generally not additive. For example, you might expect that: &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;some text&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; would produce bold-italic text. On some browsers it does; other browsers interpret only the innermost tag. Do the Final Steps Validate Your Code When you put a document on a Web server, be sure to check the formatting and each link (including named anchors). Ideally you will have someone else read through and comment on your file(s) before you consider a document finished. You can run your coded files through one of several on-line HTML validation services that will tell you if your code conforms to accepted HTML. If you are not sure your coding conforms to HTML specifications, this can be a useful teaching tool. Fortunately the service lets you select the level of conformance you want for your files (i.e., strict, level 2, level 3). If you want to use some codes that are not officially part of the HTML specifications, this latitude is helpful. Dummy Images When an &lt;IMG SRC&gt; tag points to an image that does not exist, a dummy image is substituted by your browser software. When this happens during your final review of your files, make sure that the referenced image does in fact exist, that the hyperlink has the correct information in the URL, and that the file permission is set appropriately (world-readable). Then check online again! Update Your Files If the contents of a file are static (such as a biography of George Washington), no updating is probably needed. But for documents that are time sensitive or covering a field that changes frequently, remember to update your documents! Updating is particularly important when the file contains information such as</p>
