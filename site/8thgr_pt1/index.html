<p>5 February 1999 : Bacteria bomb squad eats surplus explosives 7445 bytes Summary BACTERIA could provide the most environmentally friendly way of disposing of unused explosives A team of British scientists has discovered a yeast-like bacterium that feasts on many types of explosives , including Semtex, nitroglycerine and TNT It is now being genetically modified to degrade the whole range of explosives that various armies and manufacturers around the world want to get rid of The search has been on for some time to find a more environmentally friendly way of getting rid of explosives , and a team at the University of Cardiff has now created what it calls a bacteria bomb squad When bombs, shells and mines are no longer wanted it is possible to separate the explosive material from the case by washing it out with high-pressure water Modern explosives and propellants are usually nitrate based The Cardiff team has found and isolated a soil-based bacterium that simply "eats" the explosives by degrading the nitro Dr Graham White, who led the research, says: "Bacteria need carbon and nitrogen for growth and these explosives are rich in nitro-organics - for some bacteria they represent a good source of nitrogen White and his team set about the task by taking samples of soil, river water and sewage sludge and adding each of them to flasks containing mineral salts but with no source of nitrogen other than the nitro groups of old explosives By constantly diluting the flasks, the team was eventually able to isolate and identify the bacterium with a taste for an explosive diet The bacterium degrades the explosives down to natural compounds and minerals Depending on the amount of explosives , it can degrade materials in hours The Cardiff team has found the gene sequence of the bacterium and is able to use DNA technology to force its evolution so that it can be encoded to eat all types of explosives 2 .</p>

The material is then placed in the water and the water is stirred. After the water comes to thermal equilibrium the temperature of the water is recorded.

The document displays the current value of the attribute ("left"), then changes that value to "center", centering the H1 element. &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Using Methods&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function showAndSetAlignment() { alert(MyHeading.getAttribute("align")); MyHeading.setAttribute("align","center"); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="showAndSetAlignment()"&gt; &lt;H1 ID=MyHeading ALIGN="left"&gt;Welcome!&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;P&gt;This a short document. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. The attribute methods are especially useful when working with unrecognized attributes and invalid values. For example, if an attribute has an invalid value, the getAttribute method retrieves that exact value rather than the default value for the attribute. This means you can use the method to examine what is really in the HTML document and make decisions based on that. The following example uses the getAttribute and setAttribute methods to repair the alignment of the H1 element ("middle" is not a valid value). &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Invalid Values&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function checkValues() { if (MyHeading.getAttribute("align")=="middle") MyHeading.setAttribute("align","center"); if (MyHeading.getAttribute("xyz")!="123") MyHeading.setAttribute("xyz","123"); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="checkValues()"&gt; &lt;H1 ID=MyHeading XyZ="123" ALIGN="middle"&gt;Welcome!&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;P&gt;This is a short document. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. By default, the getAttribute and setAttribute attribute methods are case insensitive when looking for an unknown attribute. So, in the preceding example, even though "xyz" isn't identical to "XyZ," these methods get and set the attribute anyway. You can force these methods to search for an exact match by setting the optional case-sensitive parameter to true. For example, the following code, if placed in the preceding example, displays "Not found", because "xyz" does not match "XyZ". if (document.all.MyHeading.getAttribute("xyz", true)==null) alert("Not found"); If multiple matches are found for a case-sensitive usage of these methods, the actual item returned is not guaranteed to be consistent across platforms. Examining the Element Hierarchy The elements of an HTML document form a hierarchy in which some elements contain others. The html element, at the top of the hierarchy, contains all other elements in the document. The BODY element, contained by html , represents the document. Block elements, such as p , contain text and inline elements, which can themselves contain text and inline elements, and so on. You can examine this structural hierarchy using the contains method and the parentElement property. The all collection and the children collection for each element can also help determine the document structure. The contains method returns either true or false to indicate whether one element contains another. You apply the method to an element and supply another element as the parameter. For example, the following example displays the message "True!", because the BODY element contains p . &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Hierarchy&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function showContains() { var el = document.all.tags("P").item(0); if (document.body.contains(el)) alert("True!"); else alert("False!"); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="showContains()"&gt; &lt;P&gt;This is a very simple document. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. Note In the preceding example, the body property of the document object is used to retrieve the body object. The parentElement property always identifies the next element in the hierarchy that contains the element. You can combine the contains method and parentElement in a more complicated script to determine the hierarchy of the elements document. The following example uses these to determine the hierarchy, then it displays a message that shows the hierarchy. &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Hierarchy&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function showHierarchy() { var depth = 0; var msg = document.all(0).tagName; for (i=1; i&lt;document.all.length; i++) { if (document.all(i-1).contains(document.all(i))==true) { depth = depth + 1; } else { var elParent = document.all(i-1).parentElement; for ( ; depth&gt;0; depth--) { if (elParent.contains(document.all(i))==true) break; elParent = elParent.parentElement; } } msg = msg + "\n"; for (j=1; j&lt;=depth; j++) msg = msg + " "; msg = msg + document.all(i).tagName; } alert("This document contains:\n" + msg); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="showHierarchy()"&gt; &lt;H1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;P&gt;This document is &lt;B&gt;very&lt;/B&gt; short. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. Getting an Element's Position and Dimensions You can determine the location, width, and height of an element using the offsetLeft , offsetTop , offsetHeight , and offsetWidth properties. These numeric properties specify the physical coordinates and dimensions of the element relative to the element's offset parent. The following example is a simple clock that adjusts the size of its readout to fit the current width and height of the document body. &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;A Simple Clock&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="</p>

The following example uses the getAttribute and setAttribute methods to repair the alignment of the H1 element ("middle" is not a valid value). &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Invalid Values&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function checkValues() { if (MyHeading.getAttribute("align")=="middle") MyHeading.setAttribute("align","center"); if (MyHeading.getAttribute("xyz")!="123") MyHeading.setAttribute("xyz","123"); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="checkValues()"&gt; &lt;H1 ID=MyHeading XyZ="123" ALIGN="middle"&gt;Welcome!&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;P&gt;This is a short document. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. By default, the getAttribute and setAttribute attribute methods are case insensitive when looking for an unknown attribute. So, in the preceding example, even though "xyz" isn't identical to "XyZ," these methods get and set the attribute anyway. You can force these methods to search for an exact match by setting the optional case-sensitive parameter to true. For example, the following code, if placed in the preceding example, displays "Not found", because "xyz" does not match "XyZ". if (document.all.MyHeading.getAttribute("xyz", true)==null) alert("Not found"); If multiple matches are found for a case-sensitive usage of these methods, the actual item returned is not guaranteed to be consistent across platforms. Examining the Element Hierarchy The elements of an HTML document form a hierarchy in which some elements contain others. The html element, at the top of the hierarchy, contains all other elements in the document. The BODY element, contained by html , represents the document. Block elements, such as p , contain text and inline elements, which can themselves contain text and inline elements, and so on. You can examine this structural hierarchy using the contains method and the parentElement property. The all collection and the children collection for each element can also help determine the document structure. The contains method returns either true or false to indicate whether one element contains another. You apply the method to an element and supply another element as the parameter. For example, the following example displays the message "True!", because the BODY element contains p . &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Hierarchy&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function showContains() { var el = document.all.tags("P").item(0); if (document.body.contains(el)) alert("True!"); else alert("False!"); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="showContains()"&gt; &lt;P&gt;This is a very simple document. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. Note In the preceding example, the body property of the document object is used to retrieve the body object. The parentElement property always identifies the next element in the hierarchy that contains the element. You can combine the contains method and parentElement in a more complicated script to determine the hierarchy of the elements document. The following example uses these to determine the hierarchy, then it displays a message that shows the hierarchy. &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Hierarchy&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function showHierarchy() { var depth = 0; var msg = document.all(0).tagName; for (i=1; i&lt;document.all.length; i++) { if (document.all(i-1).contains(document.all(i))==true) { depth = depth + 1; } else)</td>
