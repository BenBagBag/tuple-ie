Alluvial fan and delta as mentioned before as a stream widens it will decrease in velocity and deposit its load a high velocity stream will spread out as it flows from the mountains into the valley and as a result will deposit its load in the form of a fan--the same mechanism causes a delta to form at the juncture of a large river and the ocean--examples of deltas are the Mississippi, and Amazon deltas click here to see an alluvial fan click here to see deltas C.
