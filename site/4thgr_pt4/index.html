Analyze examples of changes in the physical environment that have reduced the capacity of the environment to support human activity, as exemplified by being able to Describe and evaluate the carrying capacity of selected regions to predict the likely consequence of exceeding their environmental limits (e.g., the impact of the economic exploitation of Siberias resources on a fragile sub-Arctic environment) Develop contemporary and historical case studies to serve as examples of the limited ability of physical systems to withstand human pressure or of situations in which the environments quality and ability to support human populations has diminished because of excessive use (e.g., the drought-plagued Sahel, the depleted rain forests of central Africa, the Great Plains Dust Bowl) Develop a model using concepts of synergy, feedback loops, carrying capacity, and thresholds to describe the limits of physical systems in different environments to absorb the impacts of human activities B. Apply the concept of limits to growth to suggest ways to adapt to or overcome the limits imposed on human systems by physical systems, as exemplified by being able to Describe the limits to growth found in physical environments and describe ways in which techonology and human adaptation enable people to expand the capacity of such environments Describe the conditions and locations of soil types (e.g., soils with limited nutrients, high salt contect, shallow depth) that place limits on plant growth and therefore on the expansion of human settlement and suggest alternative uses for areas of those soil types Identify physical environments in which limits to growth are significant (e.g., extremely cold, arid, or humid tropical climates and mountainous and coastal environments), describe the conditions that may threaten humans in these environments (e.g., rises in population that place pressure on marginal areas), and then develop plans to alleviate such stresses C.
