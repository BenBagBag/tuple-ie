However, the text is only directly accessible as a node in the DOM. Use the following diagram to identify the hierarchy of the list. The first three li elements, labeled Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3, are the child nodes of the first ul element, oParent (Parent Node). The child nodes collection is exposed to oParent as childNodes , and contains Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3. As child nodes, these three li elements return oParent as the parent node through the parentNode property. Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3 are siblings and are exposed to each other through the previousSibling and nextSibling properties. Node 2 exposes a childNodes collection that contains three unlabeled li elements. The following sample is an interactive tree that provides the same information as the previous diagram. It allows some experimentation with identifying the relationships of selected nodes and introduces tree manipulation. This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. The DOM and DHTML Object Model provide a means to query a specified node to determine its location in the document hierarchy and its relationship to other nodes. Using the previous unordered list, querying the oNode object is compared between the DOM and the DHTML Object Model as follows: Parent. The parent of oNode has an ID of oParent in the HTML code. DOM var oParent = oNode.parentNode DHTML Object Model var oParent = oNode.parentElement Previous Sibling. The nodes adjacent to oNode are labeled Node 1 and Node 3. The previous sibling is Node 1. DOM var oPrevious = oNode.previousSibling DHTML Object Model var oPrevious = fnGetSibling(); function fnGetSibling(){ var oParent=oNode.parentElement; var iLength=oParent.children.length; for(var i=0;i &lt; iLength;i++){ if(oParent.children[i]==oNode){ return oParent.children[i - 1]; break; } } } Node Value. The node value of oNode is accessed through the DOM using the nodeValue property, or the innerHTML or innerText property using the DHTML Object Model. DOM oNode.childNodes[0].nodeValue="The new label"; DHTML Object Model oNode.innerHTML="The new label"; Notice the similarities and differences between querying the DOM and the DHTML Object Model. First, the parentElement and parentNode properties return the same element for this sample. Second, finding the previous sibling using the DHTML Object Model is more tedious than simply using the previousSibling property</p>

Geographical distribution of earthquake epicenters there are nearly 1 million global earthquakes per year with major tremors occurring much less frequent than minor tremors click here to see the detailed breakdown on magnitudes of earthquakes click here to see a listing of historical earthquakes click here to see map of recent global earthquakes with depth to focus information A. Circum-Pacific region is an area of many plate boundaries especially of the convergent type where about 80% of global earthquake energy is generated each year--within this region the California-Nevada area averages about 5000 earth tremors per year and accounts for about 90% of the total earthquake energy generated in the US B. Mediterranean region a large convergent plate boundary and smaller ones are present across this region and explains the generation of about 15% of global seismic energy each year C. Ocean ridge areas and intracontinental areas these two areas constitute other areas of major earthquake activity---the intracontinental areas are not associated with known plate boundaries click here to see the intracontinental earthquake locations and risk areas in the US probably the most cited example</p>

experiments Reject those inconsistent with data Conditionally accept those consistent with data Controls Variables are factors that influence processes Two experiments carried out in parallel In one all variables except one being tested are kept constant In control experiment test variable not changed Differences in parallel experiments attributed to test variable The Importance of Prediction

Basic research extends boundaries if scientific knowledge Applied research directed toward scientific industry Scientific work must be communicated via papers in scientific journals HISTORY OF A BIOLOGICAL THEORY: DARWIN'S THEORY OF EVOLUTION Evolution Provides an Example of the Scientific Process Historical Background Charles Darwin fig 1.6 Author of On the Origin of Species Published in 1859 after 30 years of observation Traditional beliefs All organisms resulted from direct actions of a Creator Species unchangeable over course of time Darwin's alternative Does not support or refute existence of a Creator Natural laws change and improve Creator's work via evolution Details of Voyage (1831 to 1836) Stops along coasts and islands of southern hemisphere fig 1.7 Observations in Patagonia and Galapagos Islands fig 1.8 Return to England After Voyage Publication of study of life and geology during voyage Forty years of formulation of the evolutionary process DARWIN'S EVIDENCE Due to Supporting Evidence Acceptance of Evolution Inevitable Darwin's rejection of supernatural explanations New evidence supporting geological events True age of earth greater than a few thousand years Fossil evidence of many unfamiliar species Lyell's writings on species extinction and emergence What Darwin Saw tbl 1.1 Extinct species related to living organisms fig 1.8 Characteristics of species varied from place to place Appearance of tortoises dependent on location fig 1.9 Slight changes in appearance after island isolation Great variety of organisms on young volcanic islands Resembled forms on mainland, not distant places fig 1.10 Supports evolution, refutes independent creation Darwin and Malthus Malthus wrote Essay on the Principles of Population Populations of organisms increase geometrically fig 1.11 Food supply increases arithmetically Unchecked population could reproduce to fill the world Nature acts to check population growth via death Darwin concluded evolution dependent on natural selection Natural Selection Organisms produce more offspring than will survive Surviving organisms are superior in certain attributes fig 1.12 Pass these characters to offspring Changes nature of population as a whole Similar in intent to artificial selection Selection for traits practiced by breeders Animals breed true for traits concentrated in them Example: domestic pigeons PUBLICATION OF DARWIN'S THEORY First Draft Completed in 1842, Years of Refinement Letter from Wallace with Same Ideas Stimulated Completion and Presentation Some Views Not Accepted, Including Man Evolving From Apes EVOLUTION AFTER DARWIN: TESTING THE THEORY Collection of Evidence by Darwin and Contemporaries The Fossil Record Darwin predicted links between groups of organisms fig

attempt to equalize the amount of work at each work station Line Balancing cuts down on idle time for the workers Line Balancing Two constraints to line balancing - precedence requirements and cycle time restrictions Precedence requirements are physical restrictions on the order in which operations are performed on the assembly line Cycle time - refers to the maximum amount of time the product is allowed to spend at each work station if the schedule production rate is to be reached When designing a product layout line balancing must be completed with these two factors being considered Computerized Line Balancing Because complicated calculations are involved in line balancing software packages have been developed to assist this process IBM's COMSOAL (Computer Method for Sequencing Operations for Assembly Lines) and GE's ASYBL (Assembly Line Configuration Program) are 2 popular packages Hybrid Layouts Hybrid layouts modify and/or combine some aspects of product and process layouts There are 3 hybrid layouts discussed Cellular layouts Flexible Manufacturing systems Mixed-model assembly lines Cellular Layouts Cellular layouts attempt to combine the flexibility of a process layout with the efficiency of a product layout Based on the concept of group technology (GT), dissimilar machines are grouped into work centers, called cells, to process parts with similar shapes or processing requirements The layout of machines within each cell resembles a small assembly line Production flow analysis (PFA) is a group technology technique that reorders part routing matrices to identify families of parts with similar processing requirements Advantages of cellular layout Reduced material and Transit time Reduced Setup time Reduced work-in-process inventory Better use of human resources Easier to control Disadvantages of a cellular layout Inadequate part families Poorly balanced cells Expanded training and scheduling of workers Increased capital investment Cellular layout have become popular in the past decade as the backbone of modern factories Flexible Manufacturing Systems A flexible manufacturing system can produce an enormous variety of items An FMS is large, complex, and expensive The emphasis for FMS is on automation Computers run all the machines that complete the process Not many industries can afford traditional FMS hence the trend is towards smaller versions call flexible manufacturing cells There are four basic types of FMS layouts Progressive layout Closed-loop layout Mixed-Model Assembly Lines Some manufacturers changed their forecasting techniques to account for this The problem with the traditional layout is that it does take into account consumers change in demand Others adopted a mixed-model assembly line technique instead There are several steps involved in a mixed-model assembly The first step is to reduce the amount of time needed to change over the line to produce different models Then they trained their workers to perform a variety of tasks and allowed them to work at more than one workstation on the line Then the organization must change the way the line is arranged and scheduled There are also several factors to consider in designing a mixed-model assembly line Line Balancing U-shaped lines Flexible workforce Model sequencing Line Balancing In a mixed-model line, the time to complete a task can vary from model to model When planning the completion time an array of values is used Otherwise, mixed-model lines are balanced in much the same way as single-model lines U-shaped lines To compensate for the different work requirements of assembling different models, it is necessary to have a flexible workforce and to arrange the line so that workers can assist one another as needed Efficiency of the assembly line can be improved with a u-shaped line Flexible workforce Although worker paths are predetermined to fit within a set cycle time, the use of average time values in mixed-model lines will produce variations in worker performance.</p>

Let's suppose that the temperature of the hot water is initially 70°C and that the temperature of the cold water in the outer cup is initially 5°C. And let's suppose that both cups are equipped with thermometers (or temperature probes) that measure the temperature of the water in each cup over the course of time. What do you suppose will happen? Before you read on, think about the question and commit to some form of answer. When the cold water is done warming and the hot water is done cooling, will their temperatures be the same or different? Will the cold water warm up to a lower temperature than the temperature that the hot water cools down to? Or as the warming and cooling occurs, will their temperatures cross each other?</p>

<p>observation 3: all organisms face a "struggle for existence" , which takes several forms overproduction : more individuals are born in every generation than the environment can support this means that most individuals die before they manage to reproduce the consequence of this is competition among individuals of the same species for access to the resources necessary to survive and reproduce interactions with other species : most organisms are subject to one or more of the "3 p's": predation, parasitism, pathogens also, different species may compete for access to similar resources interactions with the abiotic environment Darwin was very explicit in explaining that the "struggle for existence" could also be a metaphorical struggle, as, e.g., a plant "struggling" against dry soils observation #4: fitness varies among individuals note definition: fitness = relative ability to survive and reproduce no two organisms are exactly alike because of their underlying genetic differences, some individuals will be better able to survive the "struggle for existence" than others e.g., one seed may germinate a bit earlier, gaining access to light, space, water, soil nutrients before others of the same species e.g., one mouse might have slightly better hearing, making it better able to avoid predators e.g., one insect's immune system may make it slightly more resistant to a disease or parasite than another, allowing it to live longer e.g., one fish may be able to tolerate slightly more acidic water, allowing it to live in an environment with no competitors conclusion : what will inevitably occur if a-d are true (and they are for the vast majority of populations) is that adaptive traits will become more frequent in the population over time the organisms with the adaptive traits are surviving and reproducing better than others in the population because their adaptive traits are heritable, those traits will be passed on to their offspring because they have more offspring than others, their traits will be more frequent in subsequent generations as long as the environment stays the same, the same traits will continue to be favored, and will become increasingly common Another way to think about natural selection: see schematic at end of notes Note that there's nothing "magic" about selection: as long as the first four conditions are met, selection will happen Example of natural selection: the evolution of DDT resistance in mosquitoes prior to the development of DDT, some mosquitoes had an allele of a gene that could break down DDT and render it harmless - the allele was just a random mutation of a gene for an enzyme mosquitoes with that allele also had somewhat lower reproductive rates because there was no DDT in the enviroment, these mosquitoes got no advantage from the mutation consequently, they were selected against and the allele was maintained at only very low frequency in the environment When DDT was introduced into the environment, the individuals with that allele were selectively favored they survived and reproduced at a much higher rate than the mosquitoes without the allele they left more offspring - and those offspring inherited the allele the result was the increase in the frequency of the DDT-resistant allele (or, put another way, the "spread" of the allele throughout the population) Note a couple of important points about this example: the allele in question was already present in the population - the addition of DDT didn't cause the allele to arise this illustrates the general point that selection acts only on pre-existing variation - it does not create adaptive variation note that the allele itself isn't "perfect" - natural selection doesn't "create perfect adaptation", it simply selects the best alleles available in a given place at a given time the allele in question was actually selected against in one set of environmental circumstances, but favored in another because all environments change over time, traits that may have been disadvantageous at one time may become favored at another, and vice-versa selection never "ends" [ top ] [ Lectures ] [ 109N Home ] [ Dr.</p>

<p>of imported style sheets rather than HTML elements, so no identifiers are available. Use integer indexes instead. Although you can use names to access items in a frames collection, make certain that no two windows have the same name. If you don't, only the first window with the given name will be accessible. Creating new Collections: The tags Method The tags method creates a collection of elements that have a given tag name. This method filters an existing collection and creates a new collection of a given tag name. For example, the following JScript code applies the tags method to the all collection to retrieve a new collection containing only the table elements in the document. It then applies a border to each table. var doc_tables = document.all.tags("TABLE"); for (i=0; i&lt;doc_tables.length; i++) doc_tables(i).border = 1; The tags method searches for any tag name, even names that are not valid HTML. If it finds one or more elements having that name, it returns the collection. If it can't find an element having that name, it returns an empty collection. Use the length property to determine how many elements the collection contains. The collection is empty if its length is zero. The tags method preserves the order of the elements as it creates the new collection. This means the first element in the new collection is also the first instance of the tag in the document. Because the collection returned by the tags method is a subset of the all collection, the ordinal value that you use to access an element is different from the one you would use to access an element in the all collection. Sometimes it is useful to know both ordinal values. The sourceIndex property for the element returns the ordinal position of the element in the document's all collection. Accessing Element Properties Many element properties are named-value pairs that correspond to the HTML attributes of the element and to other values associated with the element. You can get the value of a property to determine how the corresponding attribute is set, and in many cases change the value of this property to dynamically affect the element. This is the key concept behind manipulating dynamic styles and dynamic content. Accessing the properties that let you change styles and content is done by accessing the element object through the collections exposed in the DHTML Object Model. For example, you can center an H1 element by accessing the H1 element through the all collection on the document and then setting its align property to "center", the same value you would use with the ALIGN attribute. var coll = document.all.tags("H1"); if (coll.length&gt;0) coll(0).align="center"; Similarly, you can change the image file name for an img element by setting its src property. var coll = document.all.tags("IMG"); if (coll.length&gt;0) coll(0).src="newimage.gif"; Most properties have the same name and take the same values as the corresponding attribute. This means most properties take strings, enumerated values, or numeric values. If a property name is different from its corresponding attribute, it is usually fairly close to the attribute name. For example, the className property corresponds to the CLASS attribute. Name changes are done to avoid conflicts with keywords in common scripting languages, or to ensure that property names don't contain characters that are invalid in common scripting languages. A few properties represent subobjects. For example, the style object corresponds to the STYLE attribute and represents a subobject that provides access to all the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attributes that can be applied to the element as an inline style. The style object itself takes properties, which you can set to alter the look and formatting of the element. The following example uses the style object to change the CSS color attribute of all H1 elements to green. var coll = document.all.tags("H1"); for (i=0; i&lt;coll.length; i++) coll[i].style.color = "green"; Some properties do not correspond to element attributes. These properties typically provide additional information about the element that isn't available through attributes. For example, the tagName property specifies the HTML tag name of the element, and the sourceIndex property specifies the position of the element in the document's all collection. Although you can get and set the values of many properties, some properties are read-only, meaning you can get the values but you cannot set or change them. For example, the tagName property is a read-only property changing the tag name of an element is not permitted. Sometimes an HTML document has invalid attributes, or invalid values assigned to attributes. If an invalid value is assigned to an attribute, the corresponding property is always set to its default value. In the following example, "middle" is not a valid value for the ALIGN attribute, so the document displays the message "left", which is the default value for the align property. &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Using Properties&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function showAlignment() { var coll = document.all.tags("H1"); if (coll.length&gt;0) alert("The alignment for the first heading is " + coll(0).align); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="showAlignment()"&gt; &lt;H1 ALIGN="center"&gt;Welcome!&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;P&gt;This document is &lt;B&gt;very&lt;/B&gt; short. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. The getAttribute , setAttribute , and removeAttribute methods give you access to the attributes of an element without using properties. You supply an attribute name, and these methods either return or set the current value of the attribute, or they remove the attribute. For example, you can get</p>

<p>Organic activity activities of plants and burrowing animals can cause a rock material to disintegrate click here to see tree roots causing rocks to disintegrate B. Chemical weathering is the breakdown of a substance by decomposition resulting in the formation of new mineral matter--water and acids especially carbonic acid (H2CO3) are important agents in this type of weathering Kinds of chemical weathering hydrolysis--is the chemical reaction of water with the substance in which the (OH) in water (HOH) becomes part of the new formed substance-- often silicate minerals will weather this way to form clays solution (leaching)--is the dissolving of substances by acid in waters usually leaving residual nonsolubilized materials--carbonate minerals are especially affected by leaching oxidation--is the reaction of a substance with oxygen causing a rust to form--manganese (Mn) and especially iron (Fe) minerals are affected although there are individual chemical and physical weathering types often combinations of these can affect the total weathering of a substance III.</p>
