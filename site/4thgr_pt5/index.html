<p>Factors which affect the rate and/or extent of weathering A. Total surface area of mineral or rock chemical and physical weathering increases proportionately with the amount of open space (cracks, holes, etc.) at the surface of the rock and extending through the rock B. Climate temperature and the amount of moisture can influence the kind and magnitude of weathering--a humid hot climate should experience alot of hydrolysis, leaching, oxidation and physical weathering from biological activity but there would be very little or no frost wedging a good example of climate affecting weathering is a granite obelisk called Cleopatra's Needle--for almost 3500 years it was in Egypt with barely a weathered trace but present in New York City for only about 80 years it has been weathered (pitted) alot click here to see Cleopatra's Needle in Egypt click here to see Cleopatra's Needle in New York C.

<p>Gravitational mass is the property of an object that determineshow strongly it attracts other objects through gravity: Force of attraction = G * (mass of object #1) * (mass of object #2) / (distance between them)^2 F = (G M 1 M 2 )/d 2 Inertial mass is the property of an object which determines how fast it accelerates when acted upon by a force: acceleration = (Force applied) / (inertial mass) As far as could be determined, the value of the gravitational mass of an object is equal to the value of its inertial mass.</p>
