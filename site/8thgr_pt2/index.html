<p>At 1991 prices, just eliminating the last two weeks of cattle feeding (finishing) would have saved American consumers at least forty cents per pound.20 Counting the grain required to produce the meat they eat, the consumption by the well to do of eight thousand to ten thousand calories per day is a major cause of world hunger.21Global production exceeds three thousand calories of food per day for each person, while the daily need is only twenty-three hundred to twenty-four hundred calories, and the potential world calorie production could be raised much more by planting high-protein, high-calorie, crops.</p>

<p>at the bottom of the list, the new node should be appended to the parent, oParent, not the last list item. By appending the node to the last list item, the new node becomes a child of oParent, not a sibling to the other nodes. The converse is also true for appending children to each list item. If a new sublist is created and appended to oParent, it becomes a sibling to the other list items, not a child of a particular list item. To create a new sublist of three items, one new ol element and three new li elements can be created and appended to the last list item. However, since this structure already exists, it can be copied with the cloneNode method. By passing true as a parameter to the method, the children are cloned as well. The following code demonstrates how the entire sublist is copied and appended to the last list item. var oClone=oSubList.cloneNode(true); oParent.childNodes[oParent.childNodes.length-1].appendChild(oClone); The replaceNode and swapNode methods are used to exchange a node with one in the document hierarchy. The difference between these methods is that replaceNode removes the node that invokes the method from the document hierarchy, and swapNode moves the node that invokes the method to the position of the incoming node. The following sample code highlights the use of both methods. &lt;SCRIPT&gt; window.onload=fnInit; function fnInit(){ var oNewPara=document.createElement("P"); var oText=document.createTextNode("This is the new paragraph"); oNewPara.appendChild(oText); document.body.appendChild(oNewPara); // Paragraph 2 is replaced with the new paragraph oP2.replaceNode(oNewPara); // The position of paragraph 1 is exchanged with the new paragraph oNewPara.swapNode(oP1); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;P ID=oP1&gt;This is the first paragraph&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P ID=oP2&gt;This is the second paragraph&lt;/P&gt; The ability to manipulate nodes allows authors to perform complex operations on the document without rewriting the content.

<p>At the macroscopic level, heat is the transfer of energy from the high temperature object to the low temperature object. At the particle level, heat flow can be explained in terms of the net effect of the collisions of a whole bunch of little bangers. Warming and cooling is the macroscopic result of this particle-level phenomenon. Now let's apply this particle view to the scenario of the metal can with the hot water positioned inside of a Styrofoam cup containing cold water. On average, the particles with the greatest kinetic energy are the particles of the hot water. Being a fluid, those particles move about with translational kinetic energy and bang upon the particles of the metal can. As the hot water particles bang upon the particles of the metal can, they transfer energy to the metal can. This warms the metal can up. Most metals are good thermal conductors so they warm up quite quickly throughout the bulk of the can. The can assumes nearly the same temperature as the hot water. Being a solid, the metal can consists of little wigglers. The wigglers at the outer perimeter of the metal can bang upon particles in the cold water. The collisions between the particles of the metal can and the particles of the cold water result in the transfer of energy to the cold water. This slowly warms the cold water up. The interaction between the particles of the hot water, the metal can and the cold water results in a transfer of energy outward from the hot water to the cold water. The average kinetic energy of the hot water particles gradually decreases; the average kinetic energy of the cold-water particles gradually increases; and eventually, thermal equilibrium would be reached at the point that the particles of the hot water and the cold water have the same average kinetic energy. At the macroscopic level, one would observe a decrease in temperature of the hot water and an increase in temperature of the cold water.</p>

<p>a weekly schedule or a deadline for a program funding announcement. Remove out-of-date files or note why something that appears dated is still on a server (e.g., the program requirements will remain the same for the next cycle so the file is still available as an interim reference). Browsers Differ Web browsers display HTML elements differently. Remember that not all codes used in HTML files are interpreted by all browsers. Any code a browser does not understand is usually ignored though. You could spend a lot of time making your file &quot;look perfect&quot; using your current browser. If you check that file using another browser, it will likely display (a little or a lot) differently. Hence these words of advice: code your files using correct HTML. Leave the interpreting to the browsers and hope for the best. Commenting Your Files You might want to include comments in your HTML files. Comments in HTML are like comments in a computer program--the text you enter is not used by the browser in any formatting and is not directly viewable by the reader just as computer program comments are not used and are not viewable. The comments are accessible if a reader views the source file, however. Comments such as the name of the person updating a file, the software and version used in creating a file, or the date that a minor edit was made are the norm. To include a comment, enter: &lt;!-- your comments here --&gt; You must include the exclamation mark and the hyphens as shown. For More Information This guide is only an introduction to HTML, not a comprehensive reference. Below are additional online sources of information. Remember to check a bookstore near you for Web and HTML books. Style Guides The following offer advice on how to write &quot;good&quot; HTML: Composing Good HTML W3C's style guide for online hypertext Other Introductory Documents These cover similar information as this guide: How to Write HTML Files Introduction to HTML The HTML Quick Reference Guide , which provides a comprehensive listing of HTML codes Additional Online References Official HTML specification A description of SGML , the Standard Generalized Markup Language Background images Forms and the essential scripts explained Java , snazzy stuff that is really perking up the Web Contact webmaster@dandscs.net with questions or comments regarding this page.

<p>Besides the nucleus, two other organelles — the mitochondrion and the chloroplast — play an especially important role in eukaryotic cells. These specialized structures are enclosed by double membranes, and they are believed to have originated back when all living things on Earth were single-celled organisms. At that time, some larger eukaryotic cells with flexible membranes "ate" by engulfing molecules and smaller cells — and scientists believe that mitochondria and chloroplasts arose as a result of this process. In particular, researchers think that some of these "eater" eukaryotes engulfed smaller prokaryotes, and a symbiotic relationship subsequently developed. Once kidnapped, the "eaten" prokaryotes continued to generate energy and carry out other necessary cellular functions, and the host eukaryotes came to rely on the contribution of the "eaten" cells. Over many generations, the descendants of the eukaryotes developed mechanisms to further support this system, and concurrently, the descendants of the engulfed prokaryotes lost the ability to survive on their own, evolving into present-day mitochondria and chloroplasts. This proposed origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts is known as the endosymbiotic hypothesis.</p>

<p>called an OUTWASH PLAIN that extends out from the glacier 47 Page 48 GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of Stratified Drift: 1) Outwash plain - broad extensive plains underlain by outwash from continental glaciers 2) Valley train - narrow and long outwash deposits from valley glaciers 43 Page 49 GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of Stratified Drift: 3) Kames - mound-like hill of stratified drift formed by the deposition of sediments by melt water in crevasses and openings in or on the ice - when the ice melts the stratified drift is left in the form of an isolated or semi-isolated mounds Kame terraces are flat-topped deposits of stratified drift along the valley walls 49 Page 50 GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of Stratified Drift: 3) Esker - a long, narrow, and often sinuous ridges of stratified drift formed by glacial melt streams flowing in tunnels beneath a stagnant glacier 4) Kettle - a depression formed by the subsidence of the surface resulting from the melting of buried ice - if the basin is later filled with water, it is called a kettle lake&#9;&#9; 50 Page 51 GLACIAL DEPOSITION Landforms of Stratified Drift: 5) Proglacial lakes - lakes fed by melt water that accumulates in low areas on outwash plains or those formed by the damming of valleys by glacial deposits - range from small kettle lake to lakes several 1000 km2 in area 51 Page 52 GLACIAL THEORY - the earliest explanation of the origins of glacial deposits was attributed to the Biblical flood - Ignatz Venetz (1821), Louis Agassiz (1837) and others first postulated the theory of glaciation - the bases for the theory of widespread glaciation was through the application of the principle of uniformitarianism (examined ancient drift deposits and similar material deposited today) 52 Page 53 GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages - the earth has experienced several episodes of widespread continental glaciation - the latest and best understood is the Pleistocene historically referred to as the Great Ice Age - the great ice age began approximately 1.6 million years ago signaling the beginning of the interval of geologic time known as the Pleistocene Epoch 53 Page 54 GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages - Pleistocene glaciers covered ~ 40 million km 2 or about 30% of the earth's land surface, mostly in the northern hemisphere - this period is marked by four glacial stages (Nebraskan, Kansan, Illinoian and Wisconsinan) and interglacial stages (Aftonian, Yarmouth, Sangamon and Recent) as recognized in North America 54 Page 55 GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages - the occurrence of worldwide glaciation can be explained by assembling the continent together in the south or north pole by plate tectonics 55 Page 56 GLACIAL THEORY - Ice ages the onset of glaciation can be explained by the astronomical theory proposed by Milankovitch - Precession - (21,000 yrs) caused by wobbling of the earth's axis - Obliquity - (41,000 yrs) changes in the angle that the earth axis of rotation makes with the plane of the earth's orbit - Ellipiticity - (100,000 yrs) variation in the shape of the earth's orbit , changing the earth to sun distance</p>

<p>Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures. A common example of a chemical substance is pure water; it always has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory. Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond (carbon), gold, table salt (sodium chloride), and refined sugar (sucrose). Simple or seemingly pure substances found in nature can in fact be mixtures of chemical substances. For example, tap water may contain small amounts of dissolved sodium chloride and compounds containing iron, calcium, and many other chemical substances. Pure distilled water is a substance, but seawater, since it contains ions and complex molecules, is a mixture.</p>
