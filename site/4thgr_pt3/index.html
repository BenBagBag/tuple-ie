<p>Benefits of a Mulch Conserves soil moisture Moderates soil temperature by insulating the soil surface Reduces soil compaction caused by equipment and people Reduces soil erosion from wind or water Slowly increases soil fertility through decomposition (organic mulches only) Reduces incidence of disease by protecting above-ground plant parts from splashes that carry soil-borne inoculum Reduces fruit rot by eliminating contact between fruit and soil Reduces winter injury by minimizing temperature variation, reducing water loss in plants, and decreasing heaving of plant crowns and roots Aids weed control Characteristics of Organic Mulches Most gardeners use organic mulches.</p>

<p>core identify sources of heat that drive dynamic changes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and interior of the earth describe methods of obtaining, visualizing, and analysing local and regional information about the earth evaluate the practicalities and implications of controlling weathering and erosion Geological Science (Earth Materials) It is expected that students will: differentiate between rocks and minerals use physical and chemical properties to identify and classify selected rocks and minerals describe the formation of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks and relate them to the rock cycle classify rocks as igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic using texture and composition describe the relationship between crystal size and cooling rate in igneous rocks classify igneous rocks as volcanic (extrusive) or plutonic (intrusive) on the basis of texture recognize ways in which the study of rocks relates to local geology and industries Geological Science (Weathering and Erosion) It is expected that students will: distinguish between weathering and erosion use examples to distinguish between mechanical weathering, chemical weathering, and biological weathering identify the origin and structure of soils describe the processes by which glaciers, running water, wind, and wave action erode rock and sediment distinguish between erosional and depositional features formed by glaciers, running water, wind, and wave action identify local features that are evidence of past glaciation describe and model the effects of stream slope, water volume, and sediment particle size in stream erosion correlate common local sedimentary deposits with possible origins, methods of transport, and environments of deposition Geological Science (Tectonics and Volcanism) It is expected that students will: outline evidence for continental drift and plate tectonic theory describe the world distribution of volcanoes and earthquakes give examples of diverging, sliding, and converging plate margins (boundaries) relate folding and faulting to mountain building relate convection theory to plate movement compare magma to lava compare rift, hotspot, and subduction boundary eruptions, and the types of volcanoes produced (e.g., cinder cone, composite, shield, basalt plateau, rift) identify intrusive and extrusive igneous features examine local and global effects of volcanic activity describe the occurrence and nature of geysers, fumaroles, and hot springs outline limitations and assumptions in the prediction of volcanic activity Geological Science (Tectonics and Earthquakes) It is expected that students will: demonstrate or illustrate the elastic rebound theory compare the properties of P, S, and L waves locate the epicentre of an earthquake given appropriate seismographic data model and explain how a seismograph works distinguish between earthquake magnitude and earthquake damage (intensity) describe earthquake effects and methods of preparedness outline limitations and assumptions in the prediction of earthquake activity Geological Science (Resources and Environment) It is expected that students will: distinguish between renewable and non-renewable resources identify the uses of ore minerals, rock and sediment materials, and fossil fuels identify and describe some tools used to gain information about the
