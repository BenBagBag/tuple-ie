light moving in one medium moves along straight line Reflection - change of direction in same medium at boundary between two different media Refraction - change of direction when passing from one medium to another at boundary between different media Diffraction - bending of wave around corners provided by different medium Superposition - ability of transporting medium to transport more than one wave through same geometrical point in space without distorting them Inverse square law - apparent brightness of light decreases inversely as square of distance from light source Doppler effect - change in wavelength of an approaching wave due to relative motion between source and receiver Straight Line Motion Light moves in straight line through empty space However, we encounter light not in empty space but passing through various media, such as Air of Earth's atmosphere Dust or water vapor clouds Pools of water Telescopes Here velocity of light may be slowed and direction may be changed These changes best understood through wave properties of light rather than its photon properties Reflection of Light Occurs when light strikes boundary between two different materials, such as glass and air When light ray moving in air reaches boundary, part may be reflected Reflected ray lies in plane formed by incident ray and perpendicular to boundary Ordinary mirror, or looking glass, is an illustration of reflection Refraction of Light When incident ray arrives at boundary between different media, part may be transmitted through Transmitted ray does not continue along same straight line as incident ray Bent toward perpendicular to boundary If medium into which ray moves is more dense than that from which it comes, angle of refraction will be less than angle of incidence If density is less, then angle of refraction will be greater Example: when spoon placed in glass of water, handle looks bent at point where spoon enters water This is because part of handle is in same medium (air) as you and part is under water, so light must pass through water-air boundary where it is refracted Diffraction of Light Is spreading out of light past edges of an opaque body instead of being propagated strictly in a straight line Light, like sounds waves, bends around corners Spread is greater for longer wavelengths Because wavelengths of visible light are very small, we do not normally observe diffraction in everyday world One example is to observe a distant street light through an ordinary window screen Adjusting one's distance from screen one sees alternating light and dark diffraction rings surrounding street light Superposition of Waves An aspect of waves which is of great importance is concept of superposition Drop two stones into a pond at different points Note that wavefronts defined by crests of two waves penetrate each other They pass unaffected through other wave Superposition Principle : When two or more waves move simultaneously through a particular region of space, each wave proceeds independently, as if the other were not present Resulting amplitude of combined waves is algebraic sum of amplitudes of individual waves Combined wave is called a composite wave meaning that it is composed of two or more waves Composite waves can be formed from individual waves that have different wavelengths that have different amplitudes that have been shifted slightly relative to each other, such as crest to trough that are going in the same or opposite directions White Light - Composite Waves Nearly all natural light sources, such as stars, emit EM waves composed of many wavelengths If waves of same wavelength superimpose so that crests and troughs coincide They are said to be in phase with each other Their amplitudes add to produce a sum greater than amplitudes of individual waves Light is said to interfere constructively If crests of one set of waves fall on troughs of other They are said to be out of phase with each other Their amplitudes cancel each other Light is said to interfere destructively Light waves of one or many different wavelengths may interfere constructively or destructively Such waves are called composite waves, or white light, since that is the physiological response they evoke Example: stars are white-light sources, even though color characteristic of composite light may be white, red, yellow, or blue Inverse Square Law of Brightness Surface area illuminated by an expanding sphere of light from a star (or a portion of it) increases as radius squared, i.e. as square of distance from light source Total amount of energy leaving star in all directions in space is same at all distances Thus amount of radiation passing through each unit of area of expanding sphere of light must diminish with square of distance Example, at 1 AU from Sun call apparent brightness of radiation over 1 km 2 of surface area 1 unit At 2 AU, each square kilometer will receive 1/4 of a unit of illumination At 3 AU, 1/9 of a unit At 4 AU, 1/16 of a unit, and so on Inverse-Square Law of Light : Apparent brightness b varies inversely as square of distance d from light source Equation: b a ( 1 / d ) 2 Doppler Effect Doppler effect, named for Christian Doppler (1803-1853) For an observer moving relative to source of waves or for source is moving relative to observer, observer will measure a change in wavelength of wave Example: effect heard as rising and falling pitch (frequency) of race car engines as cars approach and

>             Finding the original source of materials used to manufacture skis is not easily done. The materials for skis are common in many products, and factories that make these materials are scattered throughout the country. The assumption cannot always be made that the materials will come from the closest factory, since not all materials are produced in every factory, and the specific products made in each factory change based on the overall demand for each material. The best approximation for the average travel distance for any given material is to assume that the factory of origin is randomly selected. With a sufficiently large number of skis in consideration, the distance traveled is equal to the distance to the center of all the factories. This reasoning has been used to calculate the average embodied energy needed to complete the transportation phase.
