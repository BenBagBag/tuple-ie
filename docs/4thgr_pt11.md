> Size of Individual varies between species, populations and individuals large size may have certain benefits: increased competitive ability increased success as a predator decreased vulnerability to predation increased ability to maintain constant internal environment despite fluctuations in external environment (small surface-to-volume ratio) increased number of offspring that can be produced: e.g., big-handed crab (positive correlation between fecundity and female body size) however, large size may also have drawbacks: larger trees more likely to be blown down in storms or struck by lightning many predators actually favor larger prey (e.g., visual predators like fish feeding on zooplankton) larger individuals typically require more energy for maintenance, growth and reproduction&#151;may therefore be more prone to shortages of resources so, in many cases an intermediate size may actually be favored 2.
