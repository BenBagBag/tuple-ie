> is thought to have formed and is in the early part of what is called the ARCHEAN EON the cells of prokaryotes lack nuclei and the DNA is not arranged in chromosomes-modern representatives include the misnamed "blue-green algae" or CYANOBACTERIA-cyanobacteria are photosynthetic and produced much of the free oxygen in the atmosphere, paving the way for subsequent life forms-modern cyanobacteria look very similar to their fossilized ancestors preserved in rocks that are billions of years old cyanobacteria accumulate in mats in shallow saline waters and biomineralize calcite-the layer of bacteria smothers and a new layer forms over it, along with a new layer of calcite-the resulting structure is called a STROMATOLITE-they have been found in Archean rocks and they still grow today in a few isolated locations in western Australia, Belize, and the Bahamas LIFE GETS MORE COMPLICATED the first eukaryotes, cells with nuclei and chromosomes, appear in the fossil record at 1.4 billion years before present-this part of the geological time scale is called the PROTEROZOIC EON-there is good evidence that eukaryotes arose from symbiotic combinations of prokaryotic organisms-the presence of mitochondrial DNA distinct from cellular DNA was one of the earlier pieces of evidence toward this theory, which has been championed by Lynn Margulis since the 1970s-modern examples of single-celled eukaryotes include yeasts, many types of algae, protozoans like Amoeba and Paramecium and marine microplankton the oldest known eukaryotes are green algae-these fossils are found in rocks that may be as old as 2.0 Ba and are definitely at least 1.8 Ba-fossil prokaryotes are told from fossil eukaryotes based mostly on size-modern prokaryotes are rarely as large as 60 microns, while modern eukaryotes are typically more than 200 microns long-eurkaryotic organisms require AEROBIC conditions (free oxygen is present) to survive-these fossils tell us that earth's atmosphere had become aerobic by 2.0 Ba-by 1.25 Ba the first multicellular algae (seaweeds) had appeared in the fossil record the Bitter Springs Formation in central Australia was deposited 0.8-0.75 Ba-fossils of green algae occur in TETRADS in these rocks, which is consistent with MEIOTIC CELL DIVISION typical of eukaryotes and unknown in prokaryotes LIFE GETS MULTICELLULAR late Proterozoic trace fossils of burrows suggest the presence of primitive worms from nearly 700 Ma-the shapes of the burrows suggest that the organisms that made them were more rigid than a single-celled motile organism could be-even multicellular organisms without skeletons of any kind can make their bodies more rigid than the cell membrane of a single-celled organism EDIACARAN (or VENDIAN) FAUNA-in Ediacara Hills of Flinders Range in western Australia-670 Ma-soft-parts of about 30 different large multi-cellular animals are preserved as MOLDS-mixture of recognizable forms, like worms, and body plans that do not resemble any subsequent life forms-few of the Ediacaran fauna belong to familiar phyla-some workers believe that they may not be the ancestors of later metazoans, but an entire kingdom that did not survive the Proterozoic-however, the Ediacaran fauna does include undisputed Cnidaria, which do have modern relative, but are not ancestral to most metazoans For more on this topic see Ediacaran fauna a significant aspect of the Ediacaran fauna is that it made up of HETEROTROPHS-organisms that eat other organisms or detris for nutrition-all previous life forms had been AUTOTROPHIC and produced their own food through either photosynthesis or chemosythesis MULTICELLULARITY CATCHES ON by the end of the Proterozoic three of the five surviving kingdoms had evolved-the Monera, the Protoctista and the Animalia-the Cnidaria of the Ediacararan fauna are the first acoelomates-the first coelomates occur in the last 35 m.y. of the Proterozoic, an interval called the TOMMOTIAN-these animals are referred to as the SMALL SCALY FAUNA (or Tommotian fauna)-they are typically less than 2 mm and the 'shells' are composed of CALCIUM PHOSPHATE-few of these 'shells' appear to cover complete animals, but instead are pieces of more extensive armoring CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION in the lower Cambrian there a geologically sudden increase in the diversity of life preserved to the fossil record-representatives of two different kingdoms-the Protoctista and the Animalia-independently developed BIOMINERALIZATION-the manufacture of minerals by living organisms-while the organisms were alive, these biomineralized skeletons probably provided protection from predation and from the physical elements-after the organism died it provides geologists with a record of the organism's existence-the shells of many biota that emerged during the Cambrian Explosion were made of calcium phoshate-apparently the environment was very rich in phosphate at the time-later the most common biominerals became CALCIUM CARBONATE and SILICA SAMPLE PRODUCTS OF THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION kingdom PROTOCTISTA phylum SARCOMASTIGOPHORA foraminifera radiolaria kingdom ANIMALIA phylum PORIFERA sponges phylum ARCHEOCYATHA (Cambrian only) phylum ARTHROPODA (e.g., trilobites) phylum MOLLUSCA (e.g., clams, snails, nautiloids) phylum ECHINODERMATA (e.g., starfish, urchins, crinoids) the emergence of large 'shelly' metazoans and protists with mineral shells vastly increased the volume of the fossil record-exoskeletons were either AGGLUTINATED (pieces of sediment glued together) or SECRETED (biomineralized) trilobites appeared ~527 Ma and typically comprised more than 90% of the shelly fauna of the Cambrian period-inarticulate brachiopods comprised 5-7% and the other phyla make up the remainder-despite the dominance of the trilobites nearly all the other existing phyla (including the chordates) first appeared during the 30 m.y. that make up the Cambrian period THE BURGESS SHALE in addition to phyla that still exist, several phyla developed during the Cambrian (or the Proterozoic and existed until the Cambrian), but did not survive into the Ordovician period-we know this because of the discovery of LAGERSTATTEN in a few locations around the world-these deposits preserve fossilized remains of both the shelly hard-parts and outlines of the organic

> Key to this whole process is that the bacteriophage has made a mistake so that, rather than packaging its own chromosome, it accidentally has packaged a portion of the donor cell's (the bacteriophage's host) DNA (e) Note that not all bacteriophage are capable of transducing and that of those that are capable, some are more efficient (e.g., make more mistakes) than others (f) See Figure 8.5, Generalized transduction (g) [ transduction ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (8) Conjugation (a) Conjugation is a mechanism of bacterial sex (or a sex-like mechanism in that it often involves a transfer of DNA but no recombination following transfer) that occurs following the docking together of two bacteria, a donor and a recipient (b) The occurrence of conjugation is due to the presence of certain plasmids in the donor bacteria that posses genes for making the proteins involved in docking and transfer, and then it is these plasmids that typically are what is transferred from one bacteria to the other during the conjugative act (c) Note that the donating bacteria is described as being male and that the act of conjugation (if all goes as planned) serves to convert the recipient bacteria also to a male (thus, one starts with one male and finishes with two) (d) [ conjugation ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (9) Plasmids (a) A plasmid is an &quot;extra-chromosomal&quot; piece of bacterial DNA (b) Plasmids typically are stably maintained within bacterial cells, replicating fast enough that they are passed on to bacterial progeny as the bacteria divide (c) Like bacterial chromosomes , plasmids are circular, double-stranded DNA (d) The major difference between chromosomes and plasmids is that plasmids are much smaller than chromosomes plus tend to carry genes that are not essential except in certain environments (e) [ plasmids ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (10) Resistance plasmids (a) One category of genes found on plasmids code for resistance to antibiotics (b) These resistance or R plasmids often contain more than one bacterial-resistance gene (c) A bacterium containing an R plasmid that expresses the appropriate antibiotic resistance gene can survive when exposed to the antibiotic, whereas a bacterium lacking the resistance gene will not (d) Because plasmids may be readily transferred from cell to cell (e.g., just as snippets of DNA may be transferred from cell to cell), bacteria are capable of acquiring resistance to multiple antibiotics simply by acquiring a single resistance plasmid (e) Put another way, it means that antibiotic resistance can evolve in one kind of bacteria, and then that resistance can be wholly transferred (e.g., via conjugation ), intact, to a new bacterium, including to bacteria that otherwise can cause disease (f) [ R plasmids ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (11) Genetic engineering (a) Genetic engineering involves the transfer of DNA to a recipient cell using artificial techniques (i.e., something other than or in addition to sex ) (b) Often this DNA is manipulated in the test tube prior to its transfer (c) There are various means of manipulating DNA and there are various means of transferring DNA to a recipient cell (e.g., transformation , transduction ) (d) Additionally, there are various things that one can do with the DNA that has been transferred to a recipient cell (e) Note that the transferred DNA may be from the same species or from a different species than the recipient (f) Such successfully transferred DNA is said to be cloned (g) [ genetic engineering ( MicroDude )] [ index ] (12) Recombinant DNA technology (a) Recombinant DNA technology represents a number of methods employed to (i) manipulate DNA outside of cells (ii) place manipulated DNA
