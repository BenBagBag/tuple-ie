However, the text is only directly accessible as a node in the DOM. Use the following diagram to identify the hierarchy of the list. The first three li elements, labeled Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3, are the child nodes of the first ul element, oParent (Parent Node). The child nodes collection is exposed to oParent as childNodes , and contains Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3. As child nodes, these three li elements return oParent as the parent node through the parentNode property. Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3 are siblings and are exposed to each other through the previousSibling and nextSibling properties. Node 2 exposes a childNodes collection that contains three unlabeled li elements. The following sample is an interactive tree that provides the same information as the previous diagram. It allows some experimentation with identifying the relationships of selected nodes and introduces tree manipulation. This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. The DOM and DHTML Object Model provide a means to query a specified node to determine its location in the document hierarchy and its relationship to other nodes. Using the previous unordered list, querying the oNode object is compared between the DOM and the DHTML Object Model as follows: Parent. The parent of oNode has an ID of oParent in the HTML code. DOM var oParent = oNode.parentNode DHTML Object Model var oParent = oNode.parentElement Previous Sibling. The nodes adjacent to oNode are labeled Node 1 and Node 3. The previous sibling is Node 1. DOM var oPrevious = oNode.previousSibling DHTML Object Model var oPrevious = fnGetSibling(); function fnGetSibling(){ var oParent=oNode.parentElement; var iLength=oParent.children.length; for(var i=0;i &lt; iLength;i++){ if(oParent.children[i]==oNode){ return oParent.children[i - 1]; break; } } } Node Value. The node value of oNode is accessed through the DOM using the nodeValue property, or the innerHTML or innerText property using the DHTML Object Model. DOM oNode.childNodes[0].nodeValue="The new label"; DHTML Object Model oNode.innerHTML="The new label"; Notice the similarities and differences between querying the DOM and the DHTML Object Model. First, the parentElement and parentNode properties return the same element for this sample. Second, finding the previous sibling using the DHTML Object Model is more tedious than simply using the previousSibling property

> observation 3: all organisms face a "struggle for existence" , which takes several forms overproduction : more individuals are born in every generation than the environment can support this means that most individuals die before they manage to reproduce the consequence of this is competition among individuals of the same species for access to the resources necessary to survive and reproduce interactions with other species : most organisms are subject to one or more of the "3 p's": predation, parasitism, pathogens also, different species may compete for access to similar resources interactions with the abiotic environment Darwin was very explicit in explaining that the "struggle for existence" could also be a metaphorical struggle, as, e.g., a plant "struggling" against dry soils observation #4: fitness varies among individuals note definition: fitness = relative ability to survive and reproduce no two organisms are exactly alike because of their underlying genetic differences, some individuals will be better able to survive the "struggle for existence" than others e.g., one seed may germinate a bit earlier, gaining access to light, space, water, soil nutrients before others of the same species e.g., one mouse might have slightly better hearing, making it better able to avoid predators e.g., one insect's immune system may make it slightly more resistant to a disease or parasite than another, allowing it to live longer e.g., one fish may be able to tolerate slightly more acidic water, allowing it to live in an environment with no competitors conclusion : what will inevitably occur if a-d are true (and they are for the vast majority of populations) is that adaptive traits will become more frequent in the population over time the organisms with the adaptive traits are surviving and reproducing better than others in the population because their adaptive traits are heritable, those traits will be passed on to their offspring because they have more offspring than others, their traits will be more frequent in subsequent generations as long as the environment stays the same, the same traits will continue to be favored, and will become increasingly common Another way to think about natural selection: see schematic at end of notes Note that there's nothing "magic" about selection: as long as the first four conditions are met, selection will happen Example of natural selection: the evolution of DDT resistance in mosquitoes prior to the development of DDT, some mosquitoes had an allele of a gene that could break down DDT and render it harmless - the allele was just a random mutation of a gene for an enzyme mosquitoes with that allele also had somewhat lower reproductive rates because there was no DDT in the enviroment, these mosquitoes got no advantage from the mutation consequently, they were selected against and the allele was maintained at only very low frequency in the environment When DDT was introduced into the environment, the individuals with that allele were selectively favored they survived and reproduced at a much higher rate than the mosquitoes without the allele they left more offspring - and those offspring inherited the allele the result was the increase in the frequency of the DDT-resistant allele (or, put another way, the "spread" of the allele throughout the population) Note a couple of important points about this example: the allele in question was already present in the population - the addition of DDT didn't cause the allele to arise this illustrates the general point that selection acts only on pre-existing variation - it does not create adaptive variation note that the allele itself isn't "perfect" - natural selection doesn't "create perfect adaptation", it simply selects the best alleles available in a given place at a given time the allele in question was actually selected against in one set of environmental circumstances, but favored in another because all environments change over time, traits that may have been disadvantageous at one time may become favored at another, and vice-versa selection never "ends" [ top ] [ Lectures ] [ 109N Home ] [ Dr.

> of imported style sheets rather than HTML elements, so no identifiers are available. Use integer indexes instead. Although you can use names to access items in a frames collection, make certain that no two windows have the same name. If you don't, only the first window with the given name will be accessible. Creating new Collections: The tags Method The tags method creates a collection of elements that have a given tag name. This method filters an existing collection and creates a new collection of a given tag name. For example, the following JScript code applies the tags method to the all collection to retrieve a new collection containing only the table elements in the document. It then applies a border to each table. var doc_tables = document.all.tags("TABLE"); for (i=0; i&lt;doc_tables.length; i++) doc_tables(i).border = 1; The tags method searches for any tag name, even names that are not valid HTML. If it finds one or more elements having that name, it returns the collection. If it can't find an element having that name, it returns an empty collection. Use the length property to determine how many elements the collection contains. The collection is empty if its length is zero. The tags method preserves the order of the elements as it creates the new collection. This means the first element in the new collection is also the first instance of the tag in the document. Because the collection returned by the tags method is a subset of the all collection, the ordinal value that you use to access an element is different from the one you would use to access an element in the all collection. Sometimes it is useful to know both ordinal values. The sourceIndex property for the element returns the ordinal position of the element in the document's all collection. Accessing Element Properties Many element properties are named-value pairs that correspond to the HTML attributes of the element and to other values associated with the element. You can get the value of a property to determine how the corresponding attribute is set, and in many cases change the value of this property to dynamically affect the element. This is the key concept behind manipulating dynamic styles and dynamic content. Accessing the properties that let you change styles and content is done by accessing the element object through the collections exposed in the DHTML Object Model. For example, you can center an H1 element by accessing the H1 element through the all collection on the document and then setting its align property to "center", the same value you would use with the ALIGN attribute. var coll = document.all.tags("H1"); if (coll.length&gt;0) coll(0).align="center"; Similarly, you can change the image file name for an img element by setting its src property. var coll = document.all.tags("IMG"); if (coll.length&gt;0) coll(0).src="newimage.gif"; Most properties have the same name and take the same values as the corresponding attribute. This means most properties take strings, enumerated values, or numeric values. If a property name is different from its corresponding attribute, it is usually fairly close to the attribute name. For example, the className property corresponds to the CLASS attribute. Name changes are done to avoid conflicts with keywords in common scripting languages, or to ensure that property names don't contain characters that are invalid in common scripting languages. A few properties represent subobjects. For example, the style object corresponds to the STYLE attribute and represents a subobject that provides access to all the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attributes that can be applied to the element as an inline style. The style object itself takes properties, which you can set to alter the look and formatting of the element. The following example uses the style object to change the CSS color attribute of all H1 elements to green. var coll = document.all.tags("H1"); for (i=0; i&lt;coll.length; i++) coll[i].style.color = "green"; Some properties do not correspond to element attributes. These properties typically provide additional information about the element that isn't available through attributes. For example, the tagName property specifies the HTML tag name of the element, and the sourceIndex property specifies the position of the element in the document's all collection. Although you can get and set the values of many properties, some properties are read-only, meaning you can get the values but you cannot set or change them. For example, the tagName property is a read-only property changing the tag name of an element is not permitted. Sometimes an HTML document has invalid attributes, or invalid values assigned to attributes. If an invalid value is assigned to an attribute, the corresponding property is always set to its default value. In the following example, "middle" is not a valid value for the ALIGN attribute, so the document displays the message "left", which is the default value for the align property. &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Using Properties&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function showAlignment() { var coll = document.all.tags("H1"); if (coll.length&gt;0) alert("The alignment for the first heading is " + coll(0).align); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="showAlignment()"&gt; &lt;H1 ALIGN="center"&gt;Welcome!&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;P&gt;This document is &lt;B&gt;very&lt;/B&gt; short. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later.

> of offspring fig 55.11 Competition does not always involve aggression Example: elaborate feathers of bird of paradise males Females choose most visually impressive male May pose survival problem for male fig 55.12 Males become more conspicuous to predators Male survival therefore placed at risk Sexual selection involved in evolution of male ornamentation Involves intrasexual selection, between individuals of same sex Involves intersexual selection, choice of mate Causes development of secondary sexual characteristics fig 55.13 Exaggeration of trait could occur if mate showed preference for that trait Tail length in males increases as long as females choose it Choice of tail length stops when it decreases their survival Secondary sexual characteristics may reflect true quality May advertise superior genes Example: resistance to parasites The benefits of mate choice Individual receives mate`s good genes to promote survival and fitness of offspring Mate may provide resources needed for reproduction Mating systems Monogamy: one male to one female fig 55.14 Polygyny: one male to more than one female fig 55.15 Polyandry: female to more than one male System evolves in relation to ecology Area with enough resources can support more than one female If quality of area varies, female is better off with already paired male in good area, than unpaired male in poor area Needs of young also constrain mating decisions Monogamy favored if both parents needed Altricial young need extensive care, both parents needed Precocial young require little care, decreasing need for males Timing of female reproduction also affects mating system The Evolution of Animal Societies Society: cooperative group of individuals of same species Sociobiology: biological basis of social behavior Study animal social behavior as biological process Has genetic basis shaped by evolution Predicts that behavioral characteristics are adaptive and suited to mode of living Group living Is basically a selfish behavior Results in greater protection from predators fig 55.16 May increase number of individuals in group Disadvantages Parasites and disease spreads more readily Example: cliff swallows fig 55.17 Evolution of altruism Altruism: self-sacrificing behavior Important aspect of cooperation Involved with assisting other individuals in reproducing Group selection incorrectly used to explain regulation of population size Non-territorial, non-mating males don't reproduction to limit population size Good for species, as not to exhaust limited resources Flaw: altruistic trait could not be passed to next generation since male with trait does not reproduce Reciprocity Partnership formed to exchange altruistic acts Reciprocal altruism: altruists are mutually reciprocated Individuals of altruistic pair are unrelated Share no common genes Non-reciprocators are cut off from receiving future aid If altruistic act is inexpensive, gain to cheater is not worth future lack of reciprocation Example: vampire bats fig 55.18 Kin selection Haldane`s remark to lay down his life for two brothers or eight first cousins Shares 50% of genes with brothers Passes on as many genes as eight first cousins, each shares 1/8 of his genes Hamilton`s theory: evolution favors strategy that increases net flow of a combination of genes to the next generation Costs and benefits of altruism Direct aid to kin = reduction in own fitness outweighed by increased reproductive success of relatives Selection favors behavior maximizing propagation of alleles Kin selection theory: favor propagation of genes by directing altruism to relatives Inclusive fitness: genes propagated by reproduction plus effect of help on reproducing by relatives Does not equal number of direct genes via own offspring plus genes from non-offspring relatives Fitness has both personal and kin-selected components Altruism is likely to be directed to close relatives Hamilton's rule: b/c > 1/r b = benefit of altruistic act c = cost of altruistic act r = coefficient of relatedness INSECT SOCIETIES Complex Social Insects Complicated Darwin's Theory Exhibit striking forms of altruism Nearly all workers are non-reproductive females fig 55.19 Workers give up own reproduction to help mother rear sisters Evolution acts on individuals, not populations Must define "individual" in an insect society Organization of Eusocial Insect Societies The society itself is the individual Composed of castes Highly integrated groups of individuals Each individual performs certain set of tasks Specialization and organization support idea that society relates to the individual as a superorganism Individuals comparable to cells in a human body Queen analogous to gonads Possess haplodiploidy system of sex determination Workers share as much as 75% of genes Males are haploid, females are diploid Natural history of honey bee colonies Single queen, thousands of sterile, female workers Queen maintains dominance by "queen substance", suppresses ovaries in female workers Male drones exist only for mating With hive growth in spring, some females do not receive enough queen substance Colony prepares for swarming Workers establish several queen cells Old queen and some females workers move to a new hive New queens battle, winner rules old hive Natural history of leaf cutter ants Grow crops of fungi underground from leaf pieces Division of labor related to worker size fig 55.20 VERTEBRATE SOCIETIES Vertebrate Societies Are Less Organized than Insect Societies Vertebrates have larger brains, more complex behavior Exhibit lower degree of altruism Apparently due to lower amount of shared genes Maximum shared 50% Social systems still show reciprocity and kin-selected altruism Exhibit greater degree of conflict and aggression within society Conflicts center around food resources and mates Vertebrate Cooperative Breeding Helpers at the nest assist one breeding pair fig 55.22 Help feed
