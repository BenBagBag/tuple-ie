> at the bottom of the list, the new node should be appended to the parent, oParent, not the last list item. By appending the node to the last list item, the new node becomes a child of oParent, not a sibling to the other nodes. The converse is also true for appending children to each list item. If a new sublist is created and appended to oParent, it becomes a sibling to the other list items, not a child of a particular list item. To create a new sublist of three items, one new ol element and three new li elements can be created and appended to the last list item. However, since this structure already exists, it can be copied with the cloneNode method. By passing true as a parameter to the method, the children are cloned as well. The following code demonstrates how the entire sublist is copied and appended to the last list item. var oClone=oSubList.cloneNode(true); oParent.childNodes[oParent.childNodes.length-1].appendChild(oClone); The replaceNode and swapNode methods are used to exchange a node with one in the document hierarchy. The difference between these methods is that replaceNode removes the node that invokes the method from the document hierarchy, and swapNode moves the node that invokes the method to the position of the incoming node. The following sample code highlights the use of both methods. &lt;SCRIPT&gt; window.onload=fnInit; function fnInit(){ var oNewPara=document.createElement("P"); var oText=document.createTextNode("This is the new paragraph"); oNewPara.appendChild(oText); document.body.appendChild(oNewPara); // Paragraph 2 is replaced with the new paragraph oP2.replaceNode(oNewPara); // The position of paragraph 1 is exchanged with the new paragraph oNewPara.swapNode(oP1); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;P ID=oP1&gt;This is the first paragraph&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P ID=oP2&gt;This is the second paragraph&lt;/P&gt; The ability to manipulate nodes allows authors to perform complex operations on the document without rewriting the content.

> At the macroscopic level, heat is the transfer of energy from the high temperature object to the low temperature object. At the particle level, heat flow can be explained in terms of the net effect of the collisions of a whole bunch of little bangers. Warming and cooling is the macroscopic result of this particle-level phenomenon. Now let's apply this particle view to the scenario of the metal can with the hot water positioned inside of a Styrofoam cup containing cold water. On average, the particles with the greatest kinetic energy are the particles of the hot water. Being a fluid, those particles move about with translational kinetic energy and bang upon the particles of the metal can. As the hot water particles bang upon the particles of the metal can, they transfer energy to the metal can. This warms the metal can up. Most metals are good thermal conductors so they warm up quite quickly throughout the bulk of the can. The can assumes nearly the same temperature as the hot water. Being a solid, the metal can consists of little wigglers. The wigglers at the outer perimeter of the metal can bang upon particles in the cold water. The collisions between the particles of the metal can and the particles of the cold water result in the transfer of energy to the cold water. This slowly warms the cold water up. The interaction between the particles of the hot water, the metal can and the cold water results in a transfer of energy outward from the hot water to the cold water. The average kinetic energy of the hot water particles gradually decreases; the average kinetic energy of the cold-water particles gradually increases; and eventually, thermal equilibrium would be reached at the point that the particles of the hot water and the cold water have the same average kinetic energy. At the macroscopic level, one would observe a decrease in temperature of the hot water and an increase in temperature of the cold water.

Remove out-of-date files or note why something that appears dated is still on a server (e.g., the program requirements will remain the same for the next cycle so the file is still available as an interim reference). Browsers Differ Web browsers display HTML elements differently. Remember that not all codes used in HTML files are interpreted by all browsers. Any code a browser does not understand is usually ignored though. You could spend a lot of time making your file &quot;look perfect&quot; using your current browser. If you check that file using another browser, it will likely display (a little or a lot) differently. Hence these words of advice: code your files using correct HTML. Leave the interpreting to the browsers and hope for the best. Commenting Your Files You might want to include comments in your HTML files. Comments in HTML are like comments in a computer program--the text you enter is not used by the browser in any formatting and is not directly viewable by the reader just as computer program comments are not used and are not viewable. The comments are accessible if a reader views the source file, however. Comments such as the name of the person updating a file, the software and version used in creating a file, or the date that a minor edit was made are the norm. To include a comment, enter: &lt;!-- your comments here --&gt; You must include the exclamation mark and the hyphens as shown.

> Besides the nucleus, two other organelles — the mitochondrion and the chloroplast — play an especially important role in eukaryotic cells. These specialized structures are enclosed by double membranes, and they are believed to have originated back when all living things on Earth were single-celled organisms. At that time, some larger eukaryotic cells with flexible membranes "ate" by engulfing molecules and smaller cells — and scientists believe that mitochondria and chloroplasts arose as a result of this process. In particular, researchers think that some of these "eater" eukaryotes engulfed smaller prokaryotes, and a symbiotic relationship subsequently developed. Once kidnapped, the "eaten" prokaryotes continued to generate energy and carry out other necessary cellular functions, and the host eukaryotes came to rely on the contribution of the "eaten" cells. Over many generations, the descendants of the eukaryotes developed mechanisms to further support this system, and concurrently, the descendants of the engulfed prokaryotes lost the ability to survive on their own, evolving into present-day mitochondria and chloroplasts. This proposed origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts is known as the endosymbiotic hypothesis.
