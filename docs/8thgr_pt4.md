Tables for Nontabular Information Some HTML authors use tables to present nontabular information. For example, because links can be included in table cells, some authors use a table with no borders to create &quot;one&quot; image from separate images. Browsers that can display tables properly show the various images seamlessly, making the created image seem like an image map (one image with hyperlinked quadrants). Using table borders with images can create an impressive display as well. Experiment and see what you like. Fill-out Forms Web forms let a reader return information to a Web

> General Table Format The general format of a table looks like this: &lt;TABLE&gt; &lt;!-- start of table definition --&gt; &lt;CAPTION&gt; caption contents &lt;/CAPTION&gt; &lt;!-- caption definition --&gt; &lt;TR&gt; &lt;!-- start of header row definition --&gt; &lt;TH&gt; first header cell contents &lt;/TH&gt; &lt;TH&gt; last header cell contents &lt;/TH&gt; &lt;/TR&gt; &lt;!-- end of header row definition --&gt; &lt;TR&gt; &lt;!-- start of first row definition --&gt; &lt;TD&gt; first row, first cell contents &lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt; first row, last cell contents &lt;/TD&gt; &lt;/TR&gt; &lt;!-- end of first row definition --&gt; &lt;TR&gt; &lt;!-- start of last row definition --&gt; &lt;TD&gt; last row, first cell contents &lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt; last row, last cell contents &lt;/TD&gt; &lt;/TR&gt; &lt;!-- end of last row definition --&gt; &lt;/TABLE&gt; &lt;!-- end of table definition --&gt; You can cut-and-paste the above code into your own HTML documents, adding new rows or cells as necessary. The above example looks like this when rendered in a browser. The &lt;TABLE&gt; and &lt;/TABLE&gt; tags must surround the entire table definition. The first item inside the table is the CAPTION , which is optional. Then you can have any number of rows defined by the &lt;TR&gt; and &lt;/TR&gt; tags. Within a row you can have any number of cells defined by the &lt;TD&gt; ... &lt;/TD&gt; or &lt;TH&gt; ... &lt;/TH&gt; tags.

For example, suppose you collect names and email addresses so you can email some information to people who request it. For each person who enters his or her name and address, you need some information to be sent and the respondent's particulars added to a data base. This processing of incoming data is usually handled by a script or program written in Perl or another language that manipulates text, files, and information. If you cannot write a program or script for your incoming information, you need to find someone who can do this for you. The forms themselves are not hard to code. They follow the same constructs as other HTML tags. What could be difficult is the program

to produce corticosteroid hormones Corticosteroid actions Regulate production of glucose from fat Regulate balance of sodium and potassium in the blood Contribute to non-reproductive male secondary sex characteristics Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Stimulates thyroid to produce thyroid hormone (thyroxin) Thyroxin stimulates oxidative respiration Luteinizing hormone (LH) Plays an important role in the female menstrual cycle Stimulates testes to produce testosterone Testosterone initiates, maintains secondary sex characteristics Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Significant in the female menstrual cycle Stimulates cells in testes, regulates sperm development FSH and LH are both gonadotropins Prolactin (PRL): stimulates breasts to produce milk Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) Stimulates epidermal color changes in reptiles and amphibians No known function in mammals Hypothalamic control of anterior pituitary gland secretion Control is via hormones not nerve impulses Neurons in hypothalamus secrete releasing factors Carried by blood directly to anterior pituitary fig 49.14 Transported inside short blood vessels that connect two beds of capillaries One bed in hypothalamus, other in anterior pituitary Each releasing factor is specific for one tropic hormone Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates release of TSH Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulates release of ACTH Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates FSH and LH Also secretes hormones that inhibit release of certain anterior pituitary hormones Somatostatin inhibits secretion of GH Prolactin inhibiting hormone (PIH) inhibits secretion of prolactin Melanotropin inhibiting hormone (MIH) inhibits secretion of MSH Travel in blood from hypothalamus directly to anterior pituitary Negative feedback control of anterior pituitary gland secretions Hypothalamus no longer considered to be "master gland" Adrenal medulla and pancreas not controlled by this system Hypothalamus and anterior pituitary are themselves controlled by hormones End hormones feed back to regulate glands that control their release fig 49.15 Example: hormonal control of thyroid gland TRH stimulates anterior pituitary to secrete TSH TSH stimulates tyroid to release thyroxine Thyroxine acts on many target organs including Hypothalamus to inhibits TRH secretion Anterior pituitary to inhibit TRH secretion This is an example of negative feedback inhibition Example: insufficient dietary iodine Thyroid cannot produce thyroxine which contains iodine Blood thyroxine levels very low Less feedback inhibition to hypothalamus and anterior pituitary Causes increased secretion of TRH and TSH Stimulates thyroid to grow, but without iodine still no thyroxine Causes an enlarged thyroid, a goiter fig 49.16 The Thyroid Gland: A Metabolic Thermostat Located in front of the neck Produces thyroxine Stimulates oxidative respiration, helps set body's metabolic rate In children, promotes growth and stimulates maturation of nervous system Children with under active thyroids have stunted growth, mental retardation Condition called cretinism Can supplement with oral thyroxine Produces calcitonin If blood Ca++ is too high, calcitonin stimulates its uptake into bones Lowers its level in the blood fig 49.17 The Parathyroid Glands: Regulators of Blood Ca++ Levels Four small glands attached to thyroid Produces parathyroid hormone (PTH) One of two hormones absolutely essential for survival Synthesized and released when Ca++ levels in blood get low Ca++ required for muscle contraction Extreme low levels cause muscle spasms Cause osteoclasts to dissolve bone with subsequent Ca++ release fig 49.17 Reabsorbs calcium from urine Activates vitamin D to absorb Ca++ from intestine Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, poor bone formation The Adrenal Glands: Two Glands in One Adrenal glands located above each kidney Composed of inner adrenal medulla Composed of outer adrenal cortex The adrenal medulla: emergency warning siren With stress medulla produces epinephrine and norepinephrine Stimulates alarm response similar to sympathetic division of autonomic nervous system, but more prolonged Responses: increased blood sugar, faster heartbeat, increased blood pressure, dilated blood vessels in skeletal muscles, increased blood flow to heart and lungs Extension of fight or flight response The adrenal cortex: homeostasis of glucose and Na+ Produces cortisol (hydrocortisone) Maintains glucose homeostasis, thus called glucocorticoids Stimulate breakdown of muscle proteins into amino acids, carried to liver Stimulates liver to produce enzymes to convert amino acids to glucose, gluconeogenesis Important during fasting Modulate some aspects of the immune response Reduces inflammation Produces aldosterone Acts on kidney to promote uptake of Na+ Na+ needed for nerve conduction, blood pressure Prevents excess loss of Na+ and thus water from the urine Loss of salt and water causes fall in blood pressure Promotes excretion of K+ in urine Second hormone necessary for survival The Pancreas: Regulating Energy Balance Located behind the stomach, connected to duodenum by pancreatic duct Also secretes bicarbonate ions and various digestive enzymes Though to be just exocrine until clusters of cells identified Called islets of Langerhans fig 49.18 Diabetes mellitus results from pancreas damage Insulin produced by islets of Langerhans Type I: lack insulin secreting cells Treated with insulin injections Insulin used to come from animals, Now use human

cavities Have irregular, flattened shape with tapered edges Permit rapid passage of molecules across membrane Simple cuboidal cells line small ducts inside glands Simple columnar cells line respiratory and gastrointestinal tract Interspersed with goblet cells Respiratory tract cells have cilia Surface of intestine is highly infolded to increase surface area Stratified Epithelium Several cell layers thick, named according to features of uppermost layers Epidermis is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium Has an upper layer of squamous cells Superficial cells are dead and filled with keratin Glands Derived from invaginated epithelia,produce various substances Two categories of glands Exocrine glands: connected to epithelium by a duct Product channeled to outside or to body cavity Includes sweat and oil glands (external), accessory digestive glands (internal) Endocrine glands: connection with epithelium lost, ductless Secretions called hormones Hormones enter blood capillaries, don't leave body CONNECTIVE TISSUE S PERFORM A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS Structural Building Blocks fig 43.4 Derived from mesoderm Divided into two categories Connective tissue proper: loose and dense Special connective tissue: cartilage, bone, blood Composed of widely-spaced cells imbedded in an extracellular matrix Loose Connective Tissues fig 43.5 Cells scattered within amorphous, protein ground substance Strengthened by collagen, elastin and/or reticulin fig 43.5 Fibroblasts secrete collagen and fibrous proteins fig 43.6 Contains other living cells Mast cells produce histamine and heparin Phagocytic macrophages defend against invading organisms fig 43.7 Aided by cells that leave blood capillaries and enter loose connective cells May contain adipose cells Each cell stores a droplet of fat Number of fat cells in an adult is usually fixed, can change in size Dense Connective Tissue Contains tightly packed collagen fibers May be regular or irregular In regular tissue collagen fibers are lined up in parallel Tendons bind bone to bone Ligaments bind muscle to bone In irregular tissue fibers have different orientations Tough coverings of organs like capsules of kidneys and adrenal glands Perimysium covers muscles, perineurium covers nerves, periosteum covers bones Cartilage Has special ground substance made from characteristic glycoprotein Collagen fibers laid down along lines of stress Produces firm, flexible tissue that is tough and doesn't stretch Cushions bone joints, makes up skeleton of agnathans, cartilaginous fishes Chondrocytes remain alive even with no blood vessels Bone Cartilage hardened by calcification, cells die, replaced by living bone Osteoblasts are bone cells that remain alive even though matrix is hardened with calcium phosphate Hardest tissue in body may be organized into a delicate lacework fig 43.8 Blood fig 43.8 Contains abundant matrix material: fluid plasma Cells include erythrocytes (red cells) and leukocytes (white cells) fig 43.9 Thrombocytes or platelets are fragments of a type of bone marrow cell Erythrocytes are the most common blood cells Lose nucleus, mitochondria and ER during maturation Metabolically are relatively inactive Has iron-containing hemoglobin protein, carries oxygen Several types of leukocytes Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils have special affinity to biological stains Neutrophils are most abundant, phagocytic Mononuclear phagocyte system: During infections monocytes enter loose connective tissue and become macrophages Monocytes, macrophages, organ-specific phagocytes Lymphocytes are second most abundant leukocytes, part of immune system fig 43.7 Blood plasma contains nutrients and metabolic wastes Also contains sodium, calcium, other inorganic salts Includes proteins like fibrinogen and albumin Contains lymphocyte-produced antibodies MUSCLE TISSUE PROVIDES FOR MOVEMENT Muscle Cells Are Motors of the Vertebrate Body Possess large numbers of actin and myosin filaments, specialized for contraction Three types of vertebrate muscle: smooth, skeletal and cardiac fig 43.10 Skeletal and cardiac are also striated muscles Smooth Muscle Earliest form to evolve, found throughout animal kingdom Cells are long and spindle-shaped, each with one nucleus Cells organized into sheets to form smooth muscle tissue Two types of contraction occur All muscles contract as a unit when stimulated by nerve or hormone: i.e. muscles lining blood vessels Individual cells contract spontaneously causing slow, steady contraction of the tissue: i.e. muscles in the walls of the gut Contraction is involuntary and cannot be consciously controlled Skeletal Muscle Attached to bones by tendons, contract and cause bones to move Numerous muscle cells called muscle fibers act in concert Stronger contractions result when more fibers within muscle contract Contraction due to substructures called myofibrils fig 43.11 Contain highly ordered arrays of actin and myosin filaments Fibers produced during development by the fusion of several cells fig 43.11 A single fiber runs the length of an individual vertebrate muscle Each fiber contains all of the original nuclei of the fused cells Cardiac Muscle Vertebrate hearts made of specially arranged striated muscle fibers Composed of interconnected cells, each with its own nucleus Interconnections appear as lines called intercalated disks fig 43.10 Lines are really regions where cells are linked by gap junctions Interconnections allow heart to contract as single unit Functioning unit called myocardium Certain muscle cells generate spontaneous electrical impulse Impulses spread across gap junction from cell to cell All cells in myocardium ultimately contract Contraction represents one heartbeat NERVE TISSUE CONDUCTS SIGNALS RAPIDLY Composition of Nerve Tissue fig 43.12,13 Neurons: specialized for transmission of nerve impulses Cell body contains the nucleus Dendrites Thin, highly branched protrusions from the cell body Receive stimulation Axon Long tubular extension of the cell body Transmit nerve impulse away from the cell body Axon can be long, resulting in long nerve cell May be covered with insulating layer called myelin sheath Derived from Schwann cells Periodic interruptions called Nodes of Ranvier Nerves Are Bundles of Axon Fibers Central nervous system (CNS): link brain

> If you have been following along since the beginning of this lesson, then you have been developing a progressively sophisticated understanding of temperature and heat. You should be developing a model of matter as consisting of particles which vibrate (wiggle about a fixed position), translate (move from one location to another) and even rotate (revolve about an imaginary axis). These motions give the particles kinetic energy. Temperature is a measure of the average amount of kinetic energy possessed by the particles in a sample of matter. The more the particles vibrate, translate and rotate, the greater the temperature of the object. You have hopefully adopted an understanding of heat as a flow of energy from a higher temperature object to a lower temperature object. It is the temperature difference between the two neighboring objects that causes this heat transfer. The heat transfer continues until the two objects have reached thermal equilibrium and are at the same temperature. The discussion of heat transfer has been structured around some everyday examples such as the cooling of a hot mug of coffee and the warming of a cold can of pop. Finally, we have explored a thought experiment in which a metal can containing hot water is placed within a Styrofoam cup containing cold water. Heat is transferred from the hot water to the cold water until both samples have the same temperature.
