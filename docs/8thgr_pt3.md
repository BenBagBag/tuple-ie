This process uses carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce oxygen and glucose (sugars) for energy. Chlorophyll A is used to capture the energy from sunlight to help this process. Other bacteria can be considered photosynthesizing organisms, but they follow a different process known as bacterial photosynthesis, or anoxygenic photosynthesis 14. This process uses bacteriochlorophyll instead of chlorophyll A 19. These bacteria cells use carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide (instead of water) to manufacture sugars. Bacteria cannot use oxygen in photosynthesis, and therefore produce energy anaerobically (without oxygen) 18. Cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton photosynthesize as plants do, and produce the same sugar and oxygen for use in cellular respiration.

Process called conjugation Transfer of integrated F plasmid Similar process where entire genome copied and transferred Process used to locate gene positions on chromosome fig 18.24 Transposition Transposons randomly move about chromosomes fig 18.25 Transposons encode transposase enzyme Selects random site and inserts transposon fig 18.26 Destination random since enzyme doesn't recognize any particular sequence Transposition relatively rare, has enormous evolutionary impact Causes mutation Insertion of mobile element destroys gene's function Called insertional inactivation May be the cause of spontaneous mutations Facilitates gene mobilization Genes located elsewhere brought to one location Generates composite plasmid with similar genes Example: resistance transfer factors Patients treated with many antibiotics at once Bacteria contain antibiotic resistance genes Surviving bacteria have many genes on one plasmid Plasmid readily passed to other bacteria Antibiotics no longer effective RECIPROCAL RECOMBINATION Chromosomes Trade Sections Important in eukaryotes Example: meiotic crossing-over Crossing Over Occurs during Prophase I of meiosis Homologous chromosomes pair side-by-side Exchange of strands at one or more locations fig 12.6 May result in physical exchange of chromosome arms Produce chromosomes differing in mutation combination Form gametes with new combination of alleles Example: giraffe Neck length gene and leg length gene on same chromosome Mutations to form long-neck allele and long-leg allele Unlikely event to get both alleles in same individual Recombination could readily cause cross-over of alleles Gene Conversion Homologues not identical thus nucleotides not complementary Called mismatch pairs Error corrected by proofreading enzymes Excise strand, fill gap complementary to other strand Produces two chromosomes with same sequence One mismatch pair lost, called gene conversion fig 18.27 Unequal Crossing Over Pairing mistake due to same sequences at many locations Homologues line up, sequence matches with a duplicate Results in unequal crossing over fig 18.28 Exchange segments of unequal length One chromosome gains copies while its homologue looses them Results in generation of hundreds of copies of a gene THE EVOLUTION OF GENE ORGANIZATION Effects of Recombination in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes Prokaryotic genome

> exposed in the DOM. And third, notice that the text is treated as a node in the DOM and is accessible through the childNodes collection. An important distinction about a TextNode is that it cannot contain any child nodes. Creating Nodes Nodes are created using the createElement and createTextNode methods. Both methods are exposed only to the document object, and can be used in HTML documents, DHTML Behaviors , and HTML Applications . In the DHTML Object Model, elements are added to the document hierarchy by modifying the innerHTML and outerHTML property values, or by using methods explicit to particular elements, such as the insertRow and insertCell methods for the table element. With the createElement method, only the name of the element is needed. Use the following syntax to create a new element. // Create an element var oElement = document.createElement(sElementName); The createElement method is available in Internet Explorer 4.0, but only the area , img , and option elements can be created. As of Internet Explorer 5, all elements can be created stand-alone. In addition, read-only properties, such as id , are read-write for stand-alone elements before they are inserted into the document hierarchy. Some elements might require additional steps or rely on the existence of other elements. For example, the TYPE attribute of the input element defaults to text . So, to create a button control, the type property needs to be set to button , and the value property should be set to provide a label. The following sample code highlights how a fieldSet , legend , and button control are created in script to build a short form. Notice that one function is designed to create and append the elements, and a reference to the new element is returned so additional elements can be appended as children. function fnCreate(sElement,sData,sType,oNode){ var oNewElement=document.createElement(sElement); if(sType){ oNewElement.type=sType; oNewElement.value=sData; } if(sData){ if(sElement.toLowerCase()!="input"){ var oNewText=document.createTextNode(sData); oNewElement.appendChild(oNewText); } } if(oNode){ oNode.appendChild(oNewElement); } else{ oNewForm.appendChild(oNewElement); } return oNewElement; } var oNode=fnCreate("FIELDSET"); fnCreate("LEGEND","My Form","",oNode); fnCreate("INPUT","Some Text","text",oNode); fnCreate("INPUT","A button","button",oNode); This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. When creating and threading together nodes, it is important to use well-formed HTML to avoid creating an invalid tree. By creating and adding an invalid tree into the document hierarchy, unpredictable behavior can ensue. For the most part, Web authors need not be concerned. However, there are some elements, such as table , that warrant special discussion. A well-formed HTML table consists of at least two nodes: table and tBody . In the DHTML Object Model, a table , with accompanying rows and cells, can be created using the innerHTML property, the insertRow and insertCell methods, and the rows and cells collections. While the tBody element is not explicitly added, it is created as a part of the table object model. For example, the following code generates a two-cell table using the DHTML Object Model. var sTable="&lt;TABLE ID='oTable1'&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;" document.body.innerHTML+=sTable; oTable1.insertRow(oTable1.rows.length); oTable1.insertRow(oTable1.rows.length); oTable1.rows(0).insertCell(oTable1.rows(0).cells.length); oTable1.rows(0).insertCell(oTable1.rows(0).cells.length); oTable1.rows(0).cells(0).innerHTML="Cell 1"; oTable1.rows(0).cells(1).innerHTML="Cell 2"; The following HTML is the result of the previous code. Notice that the tBody element exists even though it was not added in script. &lt;TABLE ID="oTable"&gt; &lt;TBODY&gt; &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Cell 1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Cell 2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt; &lt;/TBODY&gt; &lt;/TABLE&gt; To create a well-formed table in the DOM, the tBody element must be explicitly created and added to the tree. By not including the tBody element, the nodes comprising the entire table form an invalid tree and result in unpredictable behavior. The following script outlines the creation of a table using the DOM, including the tBody element. var oTable=document.createElement("TABLE"); var oTBody=document.createElement("TBODY"); var oRow=document.createElement("TR"); var oCell=document.createElement("TD"); var oCell2=oCell.cloneNode(); oRow.appendChild(oCell); oRow.appendChild(oCell2); oTable.appendChild(oTBody); oTBody.appendChild(oRow); document.body.appendChild(oTable); oCell.innerHTML="Cell 1"; oCell2.innerHTML="Cell 2"; Manipulating Nodes Once a node is created, and its relationship with other nodes is identified, it can be manipulated. A node can be updated without any knowledge of what nodes are adjacent to it, but it is a good idea to know what could be affected if a node is altered. For example, if a Web author wants to remove portions of a list, removing the topmost node and all its children might delete information that should have been preserved. In addition, removing only the topmost node of a list might cause additional problems later because the existing list items would still exist, without the ol or ul parent. Some of the DOM methods that allow authors to easily manipulate nodes are the cloneNode , removeNode , replaceNode , and swapNode methods. These methods provide copy, move, and delete functionality to the entire document tree. Understanding how a node interacts with other nodes helps keep a document clean and the client-side script stable. For example, consider the following list code. &lt;UL ID=oParent&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Item 1 &lt;LI ID=oNode2&gt;Item 2 &lt;OL ID=oSubList&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Sub Item 1 &lt;LI&gt;Sub Item 2 &lt;LI&gt;Sub Item 3 &lt;/OL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Item 3 &lt;/UL&gt; Manipulating nodes can be tricky because it is very easy to build invalid tree structures. For example, to copy one of the list items represented in the previous HTML and paste it
