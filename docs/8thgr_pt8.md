> That depends on: Basal metabolic rate the rate an animal expends energy just to stay alive while at rest can be measured in calories per hour not surprisingly, larger animals require more energy to maintain their bodies than smaller ones so larger animals have a higher basal metabolic rate, and have to eat more total calories per day just to stay alive but as we look at animals with larger and larger bodies, the metabolic rate (calories per hour) rises more slowly than the body weight that is, a larger animal needs fewer calories per pound of body weight than a smaller animal so a smaller animal has to eat more relative to its body weight so smaller animals generally have to concentrate on foods with a high caloric payoff while larger animals can eat foods with a lower caloric content think of hummingbirds, eating high-sugar flower nectar all animals would be happy to subsist on such high-quality food, but there just is not enough of it around, or it is distributed in packages too small, to support a large-bodied animal while elephants eat leaves, straw, woody plant parts these require that the elephant eat them in large quantities and digest them for some time these foods have fewer calories per pound of food but are widely available, so a large animal with a lower requirement of calories per pound of body weight can find enough but a small animal could not stuff enough of these foods into its body at one time to get the calories it needed activity requires additional energy, so a typical animal might need to eat enough to provide twice its basal metabolic rate so a very active animal needs more food than one that moves slowly growing requires additional energy you all know that growing children need to eat a lot gestating (being pregnant) requires additional energy gestation increases a female's caloric needs up to 25% the additional calories required increase from almost none right after conception, to about 25% of the female's normal requirement as birth approaches lactating (producing milk) requires even more than pregnancy lactation increases a female's caloric needs about 50% she is "eating for two" (or really "one and a half") in addition to energy (calories) the diet also needs to include enough protein (amino acids), vitamins, minerals, some elements (like iron) calories are provided by carbohydrates, fats, and oils and the diet should not have too much of any chemicals that are toxic or impede digestion like most mammals, primates also need to drink water most need water at least once a day Food sources: different primates concentrate on many different foods most primates each many different foods, often 50 or more kinds but each species emphasizes certain foods more than others primates (and other animals) need two general categories of foods some foods that provide carbohydrates other foods that provide protein most prosimians get carbohydrates from gum and fruit protein from insects most anthropoids get carbohydrates from fruit protein from insects or young leaves most primates are fairly focussed on certain types of foods see chart on page 174 to get an idea of the variation in primate diets chimps eat mostly fruit, with smaller amounts of leaves, insects, very occasional meat, etc. Bushbabies (or galagos), a kind of prosimian, get 70% of their diet from insects, 20% from fruit, and 10% from gum Spider monkeys get 80% of their diet from fruit, and 20% from leaves Langurs get about 65% of their diet from leaves, 25% from fruit, and 10% from flowers etc. while one type of food usually predominates, most primates do eat a variety of foods unlike many other animals, they are not highly specialized on one particular kind of food categories of food specializations: insectivore : insect eater insectivores are usually small insects provide good quality, rapidly digestible food, but in small packages larger animals would have trouble getting enough food if they depended on insects unless they had some highly efficient method of getting a lot of them, like the long, specialized tongue of an anteater while small animals have to depend on rapidly digestible food, because of their relatively higher metabolic rate they simply can't eat enough volume of low-quality food to get the calories they need insectivores typically have high, pointy cusps on the teeth, including the molars, for breaking into the insect's tough exoskeletons short, simple digestive tract gummivore : plant gum eater gummivores are also usually small same reasons as insectivores gummivores typically have sturdy incisors, and sometimes canines, that stick forward and are shaped for gouging into bark and scraping off gum frugivore : fruit eater frugivores tend to be intermediate in size fruits have fewer calories per pound than do insects and gum, but are still much better than leaves and other plant parts fruit is typically more widely available, and in larger package sizes, than insects and

> the changing position of the continents was important to primate evolution in two ways it isolated some populations of primates from each other, like the New World monkeys from all the rest in Africa and Asia and it probably played a big role in causing the very different climates of the past, from tropical forest conditions that covered most of the globe, to the ice ages however, the very first primates appeared only recently, about 55 mya, and most of what we will focus on is much more recent than even that even though continental drift may be the ultimate cause of important climate changes since 65 mya, the connection is complex so although continental drift set the stage, it did not in itself have an easily understood effect on the evolution of humans the climate differed drastically from today, and changed drastically during the evolution of the primates we will have to take the climate and environment into account if we want to understand what was driving our ancestors' evolution see the chart of average global temperatures on page 316 consider that global average temperature now is about 5 C (41 F), cold but not freezing the dinosaurs disappeared around 65 mya at the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the Tertiary period the first primates appeared around 55 mya (million years ago) at the peak of recent global temperatures, about 25 C (77 F) Effectively the whole earth was tropical, hot, and wet, probably densely forested they were something like some modern prosimians - more on that soon the first anthropoids (apes and monkeys) appeared around 34 mya in a world that was much cooler than the first primates had adapted to Hominoids (ape-like primates) appeared in the middle Miocene, around 15 mya, when global average temperature was still high, about 18 C (64 F) Palm trees grew almost to the arctic circle Antarctica was open landscape except for ice on a few peaks Lots of temperate forest Then temperatures started a long, irregular decline Around 15 mya to 10 mya, as the temperature was dropping fairly rapidly and the environment would have been getting less and less tropical the hominoids diversified into many different species: the "hominoid radiation" the climate kept on cooling Hominids (the lineage leading to humans) appeared at the start of the Pliocene, around 5 mya, with global temperatures down to about 8 C (46 F) warmer than today, but only by a few degrees From there, the temperature kept jiggling down and began a series of radical, rapid swings up and down eventually causing a series of ice ages and warm "interstadials", which we will look at in more detail later it was in this period of extreme climate shifts and relative cold that our own genus Homo first appeared We happen to live in one of the warm periods, or interstadials, which started roughly 10,000 years ago.

> The chemical reactions that take place in living cells are similar as well. Green plants use the energy of sunlight to convert water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbohydrates (sugars and starches), other organic (carbon-containing) compounds, and molecular oxygen (O2). The process of photosynthesis requires energy, in the form of sunlight, to split one water molecule into one-half of an oxygen molecule (O2; the oxidizing agent) and two hydrogen atoms (H; the reducing agent), each of which dissociates to one hydrogen ion (H+) and one electron. Through a series of oxidation-reduction reactions, electrons (denoted e-) are transferred from a donating molecule (oxidation), in this case water, to an accepting molecule ( reduction ) by a series of chemical reactions; this “reducing power” may be coupled ultimately to the reduction of carbon dioxide to the level of carbohydrate . In effect, carbon dioxide accepts and bonds with hydrogen, forming carbohydrates (Cn[H2O]n).

> the children collection is undefined for overlapping elements. The following example returns the length and content of the all and the children collections of the document. Notice that there are only two elements that are children of the html tag head and BODY . The TITLE and script elements are children of the head tag, but not of the html tag. &lt;HTML id=theHTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;TITLE&gt; Look at the all and the children collection&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT&gt; function showme() { alert('all: ' + window.theHTML.all.length); for (i=0; i &lt; theHTML.all.length;i++) { alert(theHTML.all[i].tagName); } alert('children: ' + window.theHTML.children.length); for (i=0; i &lt; theHTML.children.length;i++) { alert(theHTML.children[i].tagName); } } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload=showme()&gt; &lt;DIV&gt; Some text in a DIV. This DIV will be in the all collection of the HTML element.&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. Using Collections The DHTML Object Model exposes several collections that you can use to access the elements of the document. Collections in the DHTML Object Model are similar to an array of variables created in a programming language. You can retrieve an item from the collection by providing a name or identifier for the item, or an ordinal index that specifies the position of the item in the collection. Collections indexes are zero-based, so the first item always has an index of zero. The following Microsoft JScript example displays the tag name of the p element, the sixth element in the collection. &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: Retrieving Items&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function showSixth() { var el = document.all(5); alert("The sixth element is: " + el.tagName); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="showSixth()"&gt; &lt;P&gt;This is a very simple document. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. Because index values for collections are zero-based, the index for the last element in a collection is always one less than the length of the collection. So, a quick way to obtain access to the last element in a collection is to subtract one from its length and use the result as the index value, as shown in the following example. var elLast = document.all(document.all.length-1); alert("The last element in this document is: " + elLast.tagName); You can also retrieve items from a collection by specifying an identifier. In this case, the element must have a valid identifier, set using the ID attribute. The following JScript example displays the tag name of the element that has the identifier MyID . &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Elements: IDs as Indexes&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt; function showElementWithID() { var el = document.all("MyID"); alert("The element having the identifier MyID is: " + el.tagName); } &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;BODY onload="showElementWithID()"&gt; &lt;P ID="MyID"&gt;This is a very simple document. &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt; This feature requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. Click the icon below to install the latest version. Then reload this page to view the sample. Elements can also be accessed by name, but it is important to remember that the name attribute primarily applies only to the elements that participate in a form submission. The ID attribute is an identifier that applies to every element. Be careful! While in theory ID means "unique identifier," in reality the uniqueness is not enforced. If more than one element has the same identifier, the result is a collection of elements with the same ID, rather than an individual element. The subsequent collection can only be accessed ordinally. If no element has the identifier, the result is null. When using an identifier results in another collection, the elements in the new collection have the same order as they have in the document. To obtain access to these elements, you can use the item method to apply a zero-based index to the collection, as in the following example. if (document.all("MyID").length != null) alert("The first element that has the identifier MyID: " + document.all("MyID").item(0).tagName); If you already know that more than one element has the same identifier, you can skip a step and use the optional second parameter of the item method to retrieve an element without first retrieving the collection. The following JScript example displays the same message as the preceding example. var el = document.all.item("MyID",0); if (el != null) alert("The first element that has the identifier MyID: " + el.tagName); When using scripting languages, such as JScript and Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), you can also access elements in collections by using the indexing syntax for that language. JScript offers three ways to index an array: an integer index enclosed in square brackets, an identifier given as a string enclosed in square brackets, and an identifier prefixed with a period. The following JScript statements show how to apply these. var el = document.all[2]; // is the same as document.all.item(2) var el = document.all["MyID"]; // is the same as document.all.item("MyID") var el = document.all.MyID; // is the same as document.all.item("MyID") Again, be careful when using identifiers in this way, because the collection returns another collection if more than one element has the given identifier. Always check the return value before you use it. You can't use identifiers to access items in an imports collection the collection consists
